## **Average Cost of Trade Schools in Maryland**

The cost of attending a trade school in Maryland depends on the following factors:

* Program Nature and Duration - The exact programs that a student applies for will determine the amount they'll spend on their education, as does the length of the program. Longer programs cost more than shorter ones.
* Location - A school's location also affects its costs, as urban schools in industrial areas tend to cost more.
* Specialization - Schools and programs offering high specialization tend to cost more than general programs.
* Profit Nature - For-profit and private trade schools are known to be more expensive than nonprofit and public trade schools in Maryland.

From the figures provided by organizations such as the College Scorecard, National Center for Education Statistics, Maryland Higher Education Commission, and various trade/technical schools in the state, we found that the annual average cost of attending a trade school in Maryland is between $7,000 to $11,000 for public trade schools and between $16,000 to $21,000 for private trade schools.

Of these, around $500 - $1,000 is spent on books and educational materials, around $500 - $5,000 is spent on program-specific equipment, and around $500 - $1000 is spent on student fees.

The tuition fees, however, are where the main difference between private and public schools can be felt the most. While public trade schools in Maryland charge tuition fees between $6,000 and $10,000 per year, private trade schools in the state charge between $16,00 and $31,000 per year.

## **Financial Aid for Trade Schools in Maryland**

Aspiring trade school students in Maryland will be glad to know that the state offers various financial aid opportunities that can help them significantly reduce or even eliminate their education costs. These initiatives are not run solely by the state, with some private, federal, and school-based options available.

We examine some of the most popular options in this regard below.

* Guaranteed Access Grants - The Maryland Higher Education Commission offers the Guaranteed Access Grants as a need-based grant. It includes 100% tuition assistance for students in Maryland attending public trade schools.
* Jack F. Tolbert Memorial Student Grant Program - This grant offers financial assistance to residents of Maryland who are enrolled in a private trade/career school.
* Workforce Development Sequence Scholarship - The Workforce Development Sequence Scholarship offers financial aid to candidates attending approved certificate programs that will lead to an apprenticeship. Students must be enrolled in a community college in Maryland.
* Federal Pell Grant - On a federal level, candidates may also consider the federal Pell Grant with up to $6,895 in grant volume for 2024.

## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in Maryland**

While many like to obfuscate the two, it is important to know that licensing for trade schools differs from accreditation. A state agency carries out licensing, while a host of approved commissions, organizations, and professional bodies carries out accreditation.

For trade schools in Maryland seeking regional accreditation (the most respected level), the organization concerned is the **Middle States Commission on Higher Education**. Those seeking national accreditation usually seek accreditation status from the **Accreditation Commission of Career Schools and Colleges**.

The Distance Education Accrediting Commission must approve distance programs\*\*,\*\* while the Maryland Higher Education Commission is in charge of licensing schools in the area.

Attending an accredited school helps with credit transfer, financial aid, employer recognition, and quality education.
