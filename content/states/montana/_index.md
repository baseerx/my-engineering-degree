Like most things in life, there is no "one size fits all" when analyzing trade schools in Montana. The "perfect" trade school will depend on the individual in question and other factors, such as the program in sight, the duration, and the kind of learning environment the student prefers.

To that end, we have provided the comprehensive guide below to encompass everything aspiring trade school students in the state must know to choose the perfect trade school for them.

First, we start with an overview of this state's average cost of completing a trade school program. We highlight the factors contributing to the cost before moving on to possible financial aid programs to alleviate the financial burden.

## **Average Cost of Trade Schools in Montana**

For a trade school student in Montana, the total cost of completing a program in the state can be split into various relevant costs. These include the cost of books, accommodation transportation, utility, and program-specific equipment.

Among all of these, however, the tuition costs usually contribute the most to the total cost. While it can be challenging to come up with a single figure, thanks to the varying factors, it is still possible to come up with a near-accurate estimation.

Thanks to data obtained by organizations such as the National Center for Educational Statistics, the Montana Board of Public Education, and different schools in the area, we have come up with the figures below for the average cost of attending a trade school in the state.

**Average Cost Estimation**

Our findings revealed that the total cost of attending a trade school in Montana lies between $22,000 and $35,000 for private trade schools and between $17,000 and $25,000 for public trade schools.

Included in the overall calculation are several unit costs, such as:

* $12,000 to $25,000 tuition fee estimation for private trade schools;
* $9,000 to $18,000 tuition fee estimation for public trade schools;
* $500 to $1,000 estimation for books and materials;
* $1,000 - $5,000 for program-specific equipment; and
* $1,000 to $2,000 for accommodation costs.

Other relevant costs include utilities, transportation, and student fees.

## **Financial Aid for Trade Schools in Montana**

Having access to financial assistance can be a lifesaver for trade school students. Luckily, the state of Montana and various private and institutional agencies have implemented several financial aid initiatives that candidates may leverage for lower (or even zero) education costs.

We take a look at some notable options below.

* **Montana STEM Scholarship** - The Montana STEM Scholarship offers up to $1,000 for students pursuing a certificate or associate degree in a STEM field. Candidates must have at least a 3.25 GPA to qualify.
* **Montana Access Scholarship** - This scholarship includes up to $1,000 in financial assistance for residents of Montana pursuing an associate degree or certificate.
* **Stephen T. Marchello Scholarship** - The Stephen T. Marchello Scholarship was designed to provide financial aid to students of Montana and Colorado who are survivors of childhood cancer.
* **Pride Foundation Scholarships** - LGBTQ+ students in Montana may also apply for Pride Foundation Scholarships for students in the Pacific Northwest.

## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in Montana**

In Montana, the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities is responsible for awarding regional accreditation to trade schools. The Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges awards national accreditation.

Choosing an accredited school is one of the most important decisions a trade school student can make in the state. Not only does accreditation guarantee base-level quality, but it also opens up financial aid opportunities, including the federal Pell Grants. Additionally, many employers value accredited degrees and certificates over non-accredited ones.

Apart from accreditation, trade schools in Montana are also expected to register with the state. Candidates may find a database containing approved trade schools from the Montana University System.
