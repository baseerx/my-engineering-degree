## **Average Cost of Trade Schools in Idaho**

A few factors ultimately decide how much a trade school will cost in Idaho. These include the location, the program variety, profit status, and sometimes even the accreditation status.

Naturally, schools in urban areas near industries and potential employers tend to have a higher average tuition cost. Those offering lots of programs are also often more expensive.

Whether or not a school is for profit will also influence its cost.

On an individual programmatic level, a program’s complexity, degree of specialization, and duration also play key roles in determining a student's education costs. Complex programs with high degrees of specialization, as do longer programs, cost more.

**Average Cost Estimation**

Calculating from data provided by relevant sources such as the Idaho Department of Education and the Idaho Association of Career and Technical Education and considering the above-determining factors, it is possible to deduce the annual average cost of attending a trade school in Idaho.

From our findings, we surmised that the annual average cost of attending a public trade school in Idaho is between $11,000 and $16,00, while the annual average cost of attending a private trade school in the state is between $18,500 and $26,500.

These figures include the cost of books and materials ($500 - $1,500), equipment cost ($500 - $5,000), student fees ($500 - $1,000; and tuition costs ($5,000 - $10,000 for public schools and $12,000 - $20,000 for private schools).

## **Financial Aid for Trade Schools in Idaho**

## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in Idaho**

There are many reasons for students attending trade schools in Idaho to consider attending only accredited schools and programs. These include certificate and degree validity, access to grants and scholarships, and ease of securing employment.

These factors are positive for accredited schools and programs and negative for non-accredited ones. The Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges is responsible for the national accreditation of trade schools in Idaho.

However, most schools are regionally accredited by the **Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities**, while online schools receive their accreditation status from the **Distance Education Accrediting Commission**.

The Idaho State Board of Education oversees and registers public and private trade schools in Idaho.
