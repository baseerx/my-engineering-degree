## **Average Cost of Trade Schools in Minnesota**

The average cost of completing a trade school in Minnesota depends on many things, including programmatic and institutional factors.

Institutional factors include whether or not a school is for profit, whether or not it is located in urban areas close to relevant companies and businesses, and the variety of programs that it offers. Programmatic factors include the length of the program and its degree of specialization.

Longer programs and more specialized programs are usually more expensive.

**Estimating Total Cost**

To estimate the possible total cost of attending a trade school in Minnesota, one must consider the average tuition costs, costs of books and equipment, and other costs such as student fees, accommodation, and transportation.

Thanks to data provided by organizations like the US Department of Education, the National Center for Educational Statistics, and individual trade schools in the area, it is possible to estimate the total cost of attending a trade school in Minnesota between $14,500 and $23,000.

This contributes to average tuition costs of $13,000 to $21,000, average book and materials costs of between $500 to $2000, and average accommodation costs of between $1,100 to $1,600.

## **Financial Aid for Trade Schools in Minnesota**

Understanding the available financial aid programs and initiatives can go a long way in helping trade school students in Minnesota reduce or even eliminate their education costs. Some things to look out for when identifying possible financial aid avenues are the qualifying factors, the amount offered, and the organization in charge.

Below are some prominent financial aid programs that Minnesota trade school students can use.

* Minnesota State Grant Program - includes various scholarships, some of which were designed for trade school students in the state. Applicants must be residents of the state to qualify.
* Minnesota Power Foundation - The Minnesota Power Foundation offers a â€œpositively powerful" scholarship fund that awards up to $2,000 to students enrolled in a STEM program, whether in a 4-year or 2-year associate trade school program.
* Education Matters Scholarship - includes an award of up to $5,000 for college students in Minnesota. Requires a personal essay.
* Minnesota Association of Townships Scholarship - is available to high school students seeking a vocational program at a trade school in the state. It involves up to $2,000 in grants. Applicants are expected to submit a personal essay.

## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in Minnesota**

The **Higher Learning Commission** is responsible for accrediting trade schools in Minnesota on a regional level. At the same time, the **Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges** is responsible for accrediting schools on a national level.

Regional accreditation holds more weight than national accreditation. However, it is common for private trade schools to go after national accreditation, while public trade schools almost always seek regional accreditation.

Online programs must also be accredited by a different agency known as the **Distance Education Accrediting Commission**. All schools are expected to register with the state.

As a trade school student, choosing an accredited school will give you an edge in the employment market and open doors for possible financial aid. It is also a way to guarantee a base level of educational standard that is high enough to compete with other schools.
