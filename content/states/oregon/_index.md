The average cost of attending a trade school in Oregon can fall between **$7,000 to $10,000** for the public and between **$15,000 to $25,000** for private trade schools.

These numbers are estimated based on data provided by relevant organizations such as the National Center for Education Statistics and some notable trade schools in the area.

Utilities, transportation, and miscellaneous spending also contribute.

**Factors Affecting Trade Program Costs**

The factors affecting the cost of a trade program in Oregon can be split into two categories: the factors that vary depending on the trade schools in question and factors that vary based on the program in sight.

School-related factors include location, reputation, various programs offered, and accreditation. Program-related factors include the duration of the program, degree of specialization, and accreditation, among others.

## **Financial Aid for Trade Schools in Oregon**

The state of Oregon organizes financial aid programs to ease the educational costs for trade school students in the state. Several financial aid initiatives are also operated by institutions, individuals, and the federal government.

We list some of the most prominent grants and scholarships to consider for trade school students in Oregon below

* ***Oregon Chafee Education and Training Grant*** - The Oregon Chafee Education and Training Grant offers up to $2,500 for foster care students enrolled in a post-secondary school in Oregon.
* ***OSAC Scholarships*** - The Oregon Office of Student Access and Completion (OSAC) offers an array of scholarships that trade school students in the state may apply for. These include both need-based and merit-based scholarships. Requirements vary based on the scholarship in question.
* ***Oregon Barbers and Hairdresser Grant*** - Students in Oregon may apply for the Oregon Barbers and Hairdresser Grant if enrolled in an approved trade school, specifically a barbering, cosmetology, or related trade field.

## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in Oregon**

Typically, three organizations are concerned about accreditation for trade schools in Oregon. This includes the ***Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities***, the ***Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges***, and the ***Distance Education Accrediting*** ***Commission***.

The *Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities* is responsible for accrediting schools on a regional level, the *Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges* is responsible for accrediting schools nationally, and the Distance Education Accrediting Commission accredits online trade schools.

Even though many tend to confuse the two, accreditation is not the same as licensing for a trade school. Licensing means the state has registered a school and can offer educational services. On the other hand, accreditation is awarded by agencies such as the ones listed above.
