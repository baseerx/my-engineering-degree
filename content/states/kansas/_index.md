## **Average Cost of Trade Schools in Kansas**

In Kansas, trade school students can spend as little as $8,000 for their overall education costs or as high as $13,000 – if they attend a public trade school. Those who attend a private trade school can expect to spend as little as $16,000 or as high as $32,000 for their overall education costs.

Contributing to the total average are the book costs ($500 - $1,000), program-specific equipment costs ($500 - $5,000), and additional costs, including student fees, transportation, and accommodation fees.

The tuition fees, however, are the most predominant units, contributing around $5,000 - $9,000 for public trade schools and between $12,000 and $25,000 for private trade schools.

**Factors Affecting Trade School Program Costs**

On an institutional level, the factors affecting trade school costs in Kansas include the size of the school and its location. Big schools and those closer to urban areas cost more than smaller ones in rural areas.

Additionally, as seen above, the profit structure of a school also greatly influences how much it'll cost to attend.

On a programmatic level, the factors affecting the cost of attending a trade school in Kansas include the duration of the program and its degree of specialization. A highly specialized program will need specialty equipment, increasing its cost.

A longer program will also need more materials along the road, increasing its cost.

## **Financial Aid for Trade Schools in Kansas**

In Kansas, trade school students may enjoy one or several financial aid initiatives to ease their educational costs or cover all fees, including tuition, books, and accommodation.

The following initiatives are some state and national financial aid programs for which trade school students in Kansas may apply.

* Horatio Alger Association Career and Technical Scholarships - Trade school students in Kansas may qualify for this program, granted they have graduated high school and are in financial need to complete a trade or technical program.
* Kansas Board of Regents Career Technical Workforce Grant - is available for high school graduates enrolled in technical and associate degree programs in Kansas. It offers up to $1,000 in grants.
* O’Brate Foundation Scholarship - The O’Brate Foundation Scholarship helps high school students in Kansas with a minimum GPA of 2.5 by providing between $500 to $5,000 in funds annually. They must be pursuing a trade degree at an accredited school.
* PHCC - Lastly, trade school students in Kansas, particularly those enrolled in plumbing, heating, and cooling programs, may apply for the PHCC scholarships offering between $1,500 and $5,000.

## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in Kansas**

The North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement is the most prominent organization responsible for accrediting Kansas trade schools on a regional level. The most prominent organization responsible for accrediting schools in the state on a national level is the **Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges.**

While both national and regional accreditation are considered equally valid and recognized by the state, the distinction is that regional accreditation typically falls on public trade schools. At the same time, private institutions usually seek national accreditation.

Another distinct level of accreditation is the online accreditation for online vocational schools. The Distance Education Accrediting Commission usually oversees this kind of accreditation.

Institutions may also seek accreditation for individual programs they offer.
