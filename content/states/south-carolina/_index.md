## **Average Cost of Trade Schools in South Carolina**

One of the most important factors in determining the cost of attending a trade school in South Carolina is the school's profit orientation. Public and nonprofit private schools are usually less expensive than for-profit private schools.

According to data obtained by the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education, the National Center for Education Statistics, and a few trade schools in the state, we have estimated the cost of completing a trade group program in South Carolina to be as follows:

* Cost of completing a private trade school: $10,000 - $25,000;
* Cost of completing a public trade school: $5,000 - $10,000.

The breakdown includes:

* Tuition cost of completing a private trade school - $7,000 - $20,000;
* Tuition cost of completing a public trade school - $3,000 - $7,000.
* Cost of books and learning materials - $500 - $1,000;
* Cost of programs-specific equipment accommodation costs - $500 - $5,000.

As mentioned earlier and as seen from the above, the profit orientation of a school determines how much it'll cost to complete a trade program. Other notable factors to consider include location, program duration, program complexity and specialization, and the school's reputation.
