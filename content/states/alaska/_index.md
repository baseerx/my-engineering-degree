## Average Cost of Trade Schools in Alaska

Several factors may influence how much a trade school student will pay for their program. Generally, data shows that the average cost for trade schools and particular trade programs in Alaska is around **$8,000** to **$20,000**.

These figures are significantly lower than the average cost of college programs and universities in the area. As for the specific factors influencing just how much a trade

program will cost in Alaska, they include the duration of the program, the program’s degree of specialization, particular location within the state, the cost of materials and equipment, and, of course, the availability of financial aid.

Highly specialized programs require advanced equipment, which drives up the average cost. Additionally, the longer a trade school program takes to complete, the higher the overall expenses.

As one would expect, state-specific factors such as the cost of living in the area where the trade school is located also influence the overall tuition and total cost of a program. Finally, different programs require different levels of tools and equipment with different cost ranges. All of these will affect the final tuition cost.

Candidates in the area may look towards financial aid to alleviate some or all of these costs.
