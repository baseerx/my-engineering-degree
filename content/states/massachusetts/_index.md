## **Average Cost of Trade Schools in Massachusetts**

The average cost of attending a trade school in Massachusetts tends to fall between $18,500 to $27,000. This is according to data collected from various sources, including the US Department of Education, the National Center for Educational Statistics, and individual trade schools.

Breaking down the cost, it is clear that the tuition cost is the biggest contributor to the overall cost. Trade school students in Massachusetts generally pay between $16,000 to $25,000 in average tuition fees per year.

**Notable Factors**

Generally, factors that influence the difference in education costs between different programs and different trade schools in Massachusetts include:

* **Location** - Schools in urban areas charge more than those in remote areas.
* **Specialization** - Highly-specialized programs are usually more expensive than general programs.
* **Accreditation Status** - Schools offering accredited programs in unique fields are often more expensive.
* **Duration**\- Naturally, the longer a student learns a specific trade, the more the costs are incurred along the way.

## **Financial Aid for Trade Schools in Massachusetts**

Trade school students in Massachusetts typically enjoy a handful of financial aid opportunities to help ease the cost of completing a vocational program in the state. Candidates may qualify simply by being state residents or by showing financial distress necessitating financial aid.

Candidates may also qualify strictly on merit and individual skills. Below are some of the state's most notable financial aid programs for trade school students.

* **Federal Grants** - Trade students in Massachusetts may also enroll for the Federal Pell Grant or the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant for low-income students.

## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in Massachusetts**

There are many things to consider when choosing a trade school to attend in Massachusetts, including the location, faculty, and curriculum. However, the school's accreditation status should also be at the top of that list.

Attending an accredited trade school means that candidates can receive training from a school that has already passed some tests to ascertain high educational quality. Additionally, accredited schools offer more respected degrees and certificates and are well-favored for financial aid.

Most public trade schools seek regional accreditation, and in Massachusetts, the body responsible for that is the **New England Commission on Higher Education**. For schools with national accreditation, the **Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges** is usually the accrediting organization.

Students attending online schools should look out for accreditation by the **Distance Education Accrediting Commission**.
