## **Average Cost of Trade Schools in Florida**

The average cost of attending a trade school in Florida is affected by several factors, including the specific location within the state, the variety of programs offered by the school, and, of course, the duration of the program itself.

However, even with all these in mind, it is possible to come up with a general figure for the average cost of attending a changing school in the state. However, these figures have to be divided based on whether or not the school is a public or private trade school.

For public trade schools in Florida, the average total cost per year ranges between $9,500 and $23,000; for private trade schools in the state, the average total cost ranges between $18,500 and $37,500.

While calculating these values, the individual tuition fees are between $4,000 - $17,700 for public trade schools and $12,000 - $30,000 for private trade schools. The calculation also includes costs between $500 to $1,000 for books and $500 - $5,000 for equipment, consistent for public and private trade schools in the area.

These figures are based on information provided by the Florida Department of Education, the Florida Association of Postsecondary Schools and Colleges, and individual trade schools in the state.

## **Financial Aid for Trade Schools in Florida**

Aspiring and current trade school students in Florida will be glad to know that there are several financial aid initiatives for them to take advantage of to alleviate their education costs. These include state and national initiatives and those organized by private bodies.

Below are some of the most prominent options to consider in this regard.

* Florida Bright Futures Scholarships - The Florida Bright Futures Scholarship is a merit-based scholarship available to residents of the state attending postsecondary programs. The scholarship may cover part or full tuition fees.

Candidates must meet specific requirements to apply, and the amount offered will be based on the requirements.

* Florida Public Postsecondary Career Education Student Assistance Grant - This program offers financial assistance to those in need. Candidates must be enrolled in a vocational certificate program of up to 450 hours at approved trade schools and community colleges.
* Florida Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act - This is available to students pursuing education in high-demand trade fields.
* Get There Faster Scholarship - The Get There Faster Scholarship is offered by the Florida Prepaid College Foundation. It provides financial assistance of up to $3,600 to high school graduates in Florida enrolled in approved vocational training programs.

Other national options include the Federal Pell Grant and the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant.

## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in Florida**

Students attending trade schools in Florida are expected to confirm the accreditation status of their prospective institutions for several reasons. For one, accreditation is important to ensure a base level of educational standard, while it is also required for specific grants and scholarships.

Furthermore, employers tend to value accredited colleges and their degrees more. These schools tend to have an easier path for their students to transfer credits to other institutions and pursue more advanced degrees.

For a trade school in Florida seeking regional accreditation, the organization to be concerned with is the **Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges**. In contrast, those seeking national accreditation must become accredited by the **Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges.**

The Distance Education Accrediting Commission is the organization in charge of online schools.
