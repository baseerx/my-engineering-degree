## **Average Cost of Trade Schools in Pennsylvania**

The exact amount it'll cost to complete a trade school program in Pennsylvania depends on several factors. The school's location, the variety of programs, and the accreditation status can all influence how much a trade program will cost.

The length of the program will also play a role, as will its degree of specialty. Longer programs will cost more and incur various costs, while highly specialized programs will require expensive, specialized equipment.

**Cost Estimation**

The National Center for Education Statistics and various schools in the state offer a glimpse into the possible cost of completing a trade school program in Pennsylvania.

According to these figures, candidates enrolled in a public trade school should be prepared to spend around $7,000 to $15,000, while candidates enrolled in a private trade school should be prepared to spend around $12,000 to $30,000.

Relevant costs included in these calculations include student fees, costs of books and materials, accommodation costs, utilities, transportation, and course tuition costs.

## **Financial Aid for Trade Schools in Pennsylvania**

Pennsylvania offers a few financial aid initiatives to help trade-close students reduce their education costs. The Federal government, institutions, and individual agencies also offer a few financial aid programs with the same objectives.

We examine some of the most popular options in this regard below.

* ***Pennsylvania State Grant*** - offers financial assistance to residents of the state looking to attend an approved trade school. It is part of the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency Grants and Scholarships Program.
* ***The PA Partnership for Access to Higher Education (PATH) Program*** - offers financial assistance to Pennsylvania residents looking to enroll in an in-demand program at a trade school. This initiative is also part of the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency Grants and Scholarships Program.
* ***The PA Post-secondary Education Gratuity Programs*** - another initiative in the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency Grants and Scholarships Program. This grant was designed specifically for Pennsylvania residents who happened to be orphans or children of disabled veterans.
* Other notable mentions include the ***Pennsylvania Chafee Education and Training Grant*** for formal foster children attending approved trade schools and the ***Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant***.

## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in Pennsylvania**

One of the things that a trade school student in Pennsylvania has to know about their institution of choice is the accreditation status. Attending an accredited school doesn't just open the door for possible financial aid, but it also guarantees a base level of high-quality education.

Of course, employers also tend to value degrees and certificates from accredited schools more than the ones from non-accredited schools.

The ***Middle States Commission on Higher Education*** (MSCHE) is responsible for awarding accreditation to trade schools in Pennsylvania on a regional level. At the same time, the ***Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges*** is the agency responsible for awarding national accreditation.

Along with institutional accreditation for the school, candidates are also advised to enroll in programs accredited by relevant agencies. An example is the ***National Automotive Technicians Education Foundation*** (NATEF), which is responsible for accrediting automotive programs.
