**Choosing a Trade School**

It is important to know that trade schools charge differently, even for the same programs. There are various notable factors to remember, including the school's variety of programs, its location within the state, and its accreditation status.

Some programs also involve a high level of specialization, necessitating more expensive equipment and contributing to higher equipment costs.

All these are things an aspiring business school student in Michigan must remember when choosing a training destination.

## **Financial Aid for Trade Schools in Michigan**

While the cost of attending a trade school in Michigan is relatively lower than in some states and lower than that of attending conventional colleges and universities, candidates can reduce the cost even further.

They may do so by taking advantage of numerous scholarships and grants made available by different financial aid programs and initiatives. We take a look at some of these below.

* Trade school students in Michigan who graduated from a high school in the state with at least a 3.71 GPA may apply for the **Daniel Gerber Sr. Medallion Scholarship**. It awards up to $10,600 for four years. It is a merit-based scholarship.
* **Clarence A. Buck Iles Scholarship** offers varying amounts for building trade students in Saginaw County. The Saginaw Community Foundation organizes it.

* Other notable mentions include the **Kidsâ€™ Chance Michigan** award for children of workers killed or injured in the workplace and the **Tiderington Family Scholarship** for residents of Saginaw County planning to attend a trade school.

## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in Michigan**

Many aspiring trade school students in Michigan need to check the accreditation status of their institution of choice, even though doing so is one of the most important things when choosing a training destination.

Accreditation is important to help candidates take advantage of financial aid opportunities and ensure high educational standards and better career prospects.

Accreditation for schools in the United States is usually done on a regional or national level. For regional accreditation, all schools in Michigan fall under the jurisdiction of the **Higher Learning Commission**.

For national accreditation, however, the accrediting agency concerned is the **Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges.**

Schools also seek programmatic accreditation for individual programs. Examples are the **Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing** (ACEN) for nursing programs and the **National Automotive Technicians Education Foundation** (NATEF) for automotive programs.
