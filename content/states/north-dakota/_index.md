## **Average Cost of Trade Schools in North Dakota**

The average cost of attending a trade school in North Dakota can be estimated based on whether the school is for-profit (typically some private schools) or not-for-profit (typically a few private and public schools).

For public trade schools in North Dakota, the average cost of completing a program ranges between $15,000 and $30,000 per year. For private trade schools in the state, the average education cost ranges between $3,000 to $10,000 per year.

These figures were obtained from data provided by the National Center for Education Statistics and individual trade schools in the state. Factored in are the costs of books, accommodation, program-specific equipment, and, of course, the tuition fees, which make up the bulk of the calculations.

**Disparity Between Programs and Schools**

The above figures are estimations on a general level. However, several factors contribute to the disparity in education costs at different trade programs and schools within North Dakota.

These include duration and specialty on a programmatic level and location and variety on an institutional level.

Regarding duration and specialty, the length of a program contributes to how much a student will spend during its course, while the specialty also influences the specific equipment needed.

Concerning location and variety, schools in urban locations are usually more expensive. The same goes for schools offering various programs spanning different fields.

## **Financial Aid for Trade Schools in North Dakota**

Financial assistance initiatives help students reduce or eliminate their education costs. With varying requirements, these programs are available for trade school students in North Dakota.

We explore some of the most prominent options in the list below.

* ***The Cass County Electric Cooperative Line Workers Scholarship*** - offers up to $1,000 for students in Cass County pursuing a certificate or associate degree from a trade school in North Dakota.
* ***Lynnes Welding Training Scholarship*** - offers varying financial support to students attending the Lynnes Welding Training Program. It is administered in conjunction with the American Welding Society.
* ***Merit Shop Construction Scholarship*** - The Associated Builders and Contractors of Minnesota and North Dakota organize the Merit Shop Construction Scholarship. Candidates must be North Dakota State College of Science students to apply. Veterans of the armed forces may also apply.
* Other notable mentions include the ***North Dakota Academic, Career, and Technical Education Scholarship*** for high school students planning to attend a trade school in the state and the ***North Dakota Career Builders Scholarship and Loan Repayment Program*** offering up to $17,000 for trade school students with a GPA at least of 2.5.

## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in North Dakota**

Licensing and accreditation are two of the most important things to look out for in a trade school. Usually, licensing is needed before a school can teach legally in the state. However, even though a school is licensed/registered, it still needs the right accreditation.

Typically, accreditation for trade schools in North Dakota is overseen by the ***Higher Learning Commission***. However, this is only pertinent for schools seeking regional accreditation. The agency in charge of national accreditation is the ***Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges.***

Regional accreditation is often suitable for programs requiring credit transfer between institutions. National accreditation is usually common among highly specialized programs and private schools.

Lastly, online trade schools are also expected to be accredited by the ***Distance Education Accrediting Commission.***
