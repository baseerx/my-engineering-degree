## **Average Cost of Trade Schools in Kentucky**

The average cost of attending a trade school in Kentucky can be split into the tuition cost, cost of books, cost of program-specific equipment, student fees, accommodation costs, transportation, and more.

Naturally, these factors vary from school to school, so it can take a lot of work to give a single general picture of the amount a prospective trade school student will spend during their training in Kentucky.

However, it is possible to get an estimation thanks to data provided by organizations, including the National Center for Education Statistics, The College Board, the Kentucky Education Cabinet, and individual trade schools.

**Average Total Cost Estimation**

Our findings reveal that the annual average cost of attending a trade school in Kentucky is between $16,000 and $31,000 for private trade schools and between $7,000 and $10,000 for public trade schools in the area.

**Unit Costs & Other Factors**

Making up the total cost are books and equipment, which can range between $500 to $1,000; and program-specific equipment, which can range between $500 to $5,000—and student fees, which can range between $500 to $1,000.

Furthermore, the annual average tuition fee of private trade schools in Kentucky is between $15,000 and $30,000, while the annual average tuition fee of public trade schools in the area is between $6,000 and $9,000.

Program-specific factors such as the length of the program and its complexity will also determine how much a trade school student in Kentucky will end up paying for their overall education.

## **Financial Aid for Trade Schools in Kentucky**

Financial aid is great for helping trade students in Kentucky relieve all or part of their education costs. While some of the financial aid initiatives in the state are merit-based, a significant number of them are available for those who simply need financial assistance to pursue their goals.

We look at some of the most prominent financial aid programs for trade school students in Kentucky below.

* Kentucky Tuition Grant - gives up to $3,000 in financial assistance for residents looking to attend associate programs or bachelor's programs in the state. Aspiring trade professionals may use it to attend private trade schools in Kentucky rather than public ones.

## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in Kentucky**

Apart from the fact that it lends credence to degrees and certificates obtained, attending an accredited school is also important to secure access to financial aid and grants such as the ones mentioned earlier.

It is also infinitely easier to transfer credits from an accredited school in Kentucky to another accredited school than from an unaccredited school in the state.

For national accreditation of trade schools in Kentucky, the **Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges** is the most popular organization to consider. In contrast, for regional accreditation, the **Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges** is the organization of interest.
