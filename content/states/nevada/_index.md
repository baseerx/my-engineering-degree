## **Average Cost of Trade Schools in Nevada**

Even though we are discussing trade schools in general, there are significant differences from one school to another. It is usually challenging to come up with a definite figure for the total cost of attending a trade school in Nevada.

However, thanks to data provided by relevant agencies like the Nevada Department of Education, the National Center for Educational Statistics, and individual trade schools in the state, it becomes apparent that the total average cost of attending a trade school in Nevada ranges between $18,000 - $27,000 for public trades schools, and between $24,000 to $38,000 for private trades schools.

For the tuition fees only, public trade schools in Nevada charge between $9,000 and $17,000, while the same fees cost between $13,000 and $28,000 for private trade schools in the state.

Other relevant costs include book and material costs ($500 to $1,000 yearly), equipment costs ($500 to $5,000 yearly), accommodation costs ($1,200 to $2,500 yearly), and more.

**Relevant Factors**

Judging from the figures above, one of the most important factors in determining the total cost of attending a trade school in Nevada is whether or not the school is a private or public institution. It is also important to consider the program duration and the degree of specialization, seeing as longer and more specialized programs tend to cost more.

## **Financial Aid for Trade Schools in Nevada**

Below are some of the most relevant financial aid programs trade students in Nevada may use to ease their financial load. Some programs offer merit grants and scholarships, while others are for candidates in need.

Some are open to all trade school students, so long as they're state residents.

* **The Nevada Promise Scholarship** - offers tuition and fee payments for residents of Nevada attending a community college in the state. Applicants must have a high school diploma or GED to qualify.
* **Regents' Scholar Award** - is available for one student at a Nevada community college, state college, or university who has demonstrated academic achievements and leadership qualities.
* **Public Education Foundation Scholarships** - this scholarship offers various financial assistance to trade school students in Nevada. It includes over 370 scholarships and is organized by the Public Education Foundation.
* Other notable mentions include the **Horatio Alger Career & Technical Scholarship,** offering up to $2,500 for career and technical school students, and the **Otto A. Huth Scholarship** for Nevada students with a 2.0 GPA.

## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in Nevada**

The Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities is responsible for accrediting trade schools in Nevada on a regional level. For national accreditation, the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges is the most prominent agency to consider.

For online accreditation, the Distance Education Accrediting Commission leads the way.

The question of whether a school pursues national or regional accreditation depends on a lot of factors. Ultimately, both accreditation channels are valid.

Another important thing to note is that accreditation is different from licensing. All schools in the state must be licensed before they can begin to accept enrollments.

The Nevada System of Higher Education maintains a database of licensed trade schools in the area.
