## **Average Cost of Trade Schools in North Carolina**

Before we discuss the potential cost of attending a trade school in North Carolina, it is important to highlight some of the factors that can influence these costs in the first place. They include the following.

* Location - Although not always, schools tend to charge tuition based on location. Those near urban areas are typically more expensive than those in remote locations.
* Specialty - Schools offering specialty programs typically require advanced and scarce equipment, which costs more. For this reason, these programs can also be more expensive.
* Duration - The longer it takes to complete a program, the higher the cost.
* Accreditation - Accredited schools, particularly on a programmatic level for special programs, are typically more expensive.
* Variety - Often, the more programs a trade school offers, the higher the cost of attending such schools.

**Total Cost Estimation**

Despite the disparity between schools, estimating how much it will cost to attend a trade school in North Carolina is possible. This is thanks to data made available by several institutions, such as the ***National Center for Education Statistics*** and specific trade schools in North Carolina.

Typically, the total cost falls between $3,000 and $10,000 per year for public trade schools and between $15,000 and $30,000 for private trade schools. Included in this calculation are the costs of books and materials (($500 - $1,000) and accommodation costs ($300 - $1,000 per month).

Other notable costs include student fees, program-specific equipment, utilities, and more.

## **Financial Aid for Trade Schools in North Carolina**

Aspiring trade school students in North Carolina will be glad to know that several financial aid programs can help alleviate the costs above. A few of these programs are merit-based, while some are entirely need-based.

The following are some of the most notable options in this regard.

* ***The Wells Fargo Technical Scholarship Program*** - is available to students of North Carolina who are in the second year of a 2-year technical program. It is a financial needs program and awards up to $500 per candidate.
* ***North Carolina Community College Foundations Scholarship for Health Careers*** - offers up to $1,000 for students in a North Carolina community college enrolled in an allied health program.
* ***Golden LEAF Scholarship Program*** - offers up to $750 per semester for students in community colleges in North Carolina. Candidates must demonstrate that they are in financial need.
* ***George W. Ballard Memorial Scholarship*** - offers up to 90% tuition coverage for North Carolina community college students. They must be state residents and pursue a program in air conditioning, heating, and refrigeration.
* ***PHCC Foundation Scholarships*** - also applicable to residents of North Carolina pursuing a program in air conditioning, heating, and refrigeration, including those enrolled in the trade school.

## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in North Carolina**

Accreditation is an important topic for trade school students anywhere. Without accreditation, securing financial aid — especially on the federal and state levels — becomes harder and leaves room for doubt concerning a school's educational standards.

Trade school students in North Carolina are expected to confirm that their schools are accredited on a regional or national level. Although regional accreditation is often considered the better, both are valid across several scenarios.

The *Southern Association of Colleges and Schools* is responsible for accrediting trade schools in North Carolina on a regional level. At the same time, the *Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges* is responsible for national accreditation.

The *Distance Education Accrediting Commission* awards accreditation for online schools, while specific programs may also be required to obtain accreditation.
