## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in West Virginia**

Licensing trade schools in West Virginia typically falls upon the Higher Learning Commission. Most public trade schools in the state often receive accreditation from the commission to satisfy regional requirements.

However, private trade schools and other post-secondary institutions may turn to the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges for accreditation. The Distance Education Accrediting Commission accredits online schools.

Usually, national accreditation is enough for specialized programs that require credit transfer. Students are advised to enroll in an accredited school – either nationally or regionally – because it gives more gravitas to their degrees and may help them access several financial aid initiatives.

Besides being accredited, candidates must also ensure that the state licenses their trade school of choice in West Virginia.
