## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in Vermont**

Trade school students in Vermont will find their careers a lot smoother if they attend only accredited trade schools in the state. For instance, transferring credits between accredited schools is much easier than from a school without or with a different accreditation.

Speaking of different accreditations, the ***New England Commission of Higher Education*** is responsible for awarding accreditation to trade schools in Vermont â€” on a regional level. The ***Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges*** is responsible for issuing accreditation to trade schools on a national level.

Both national and regional accreditation are valid, with the major difference being the ease of credit transfer, a department in which regional accreditation is usually more versatile.

Along with accreditation, trade schools are also expected to be registered and licensed. The state itself is responsible for maintaining a list of trade schools that have been approved to start enrolling students.
