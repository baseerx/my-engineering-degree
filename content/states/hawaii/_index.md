## **Average Cost of Trade Schools in Hawaii**

While it is impossible to accurately outline the exact cost of attending a trade school in Hawaii, it is possible to acquire a general picture of the possible average cost based on the accumulation of related costs and the data provided by relevant organizations such as the Hawaii Department of Education and the Hawaii Association of Independent Schools, among others.

Going by this, we have deduced that the average cost of attending a private trade school in Hawaii is usually between $21,500 and $36,500, while the average cost of attending a public trade school is between $12,000 and $18,000.

**Breaking Down the Cost**

The most predominant agents influencing the total average cost of attending a trade school are the tuition fees, cost of materials and books, equipment cost specific to each program, and student fees.

The average tuition fee for private trade schools in Hawaii is $15,000 - $30,000, while the average tuition cost of attending a public trade school is $6,000 - $12,000.

For both trade schools in the state, the average equipment cost ranges from $500 to $5,000, while the average student and book fees range from $500 to $1,500.

**Relevant Determinants**

There are several key players in determining how much a student will pay for a trade program in Hawaii, and these fees differ from institution to institution. However, among the most dominant of these factors are location, specialization, and program length.

Longer programs cost more, as do those located in urban areas and those requiring a high degree of specialization. Of course, financial aid and scholarships can help immensely with these costs.

## **Financial Aid for Trade Schools in Hawaii**
