## **Average Cost of Trade Schools in California**

Due to the range and differences in arrangements between trade schools in California, it is usually tough to give a definite general fee for schools in the area. However, sorting through data from various sources, including the California Department of Education and individual schools in the state, it becomes apparent that the total average cost of attending a trade school in California is between $14,000 and $22,000 for public trade schools.

For private trade schools, however, the figure rises slightly between **$18,000** and **$33,000**.

Concerning tuition fees only, public trade schools in California cost around $8,000 to $15,000, while private trade schools cost between $12,000 to $25,000. Additional fees include books and materials ($500 - $1000 yearly), equipment ($500 to $500), and likely student fees ($500 - $100).

The data above shows that various conditions can influence how much a trade school student pays. Here, we've already seen the impact of school arrangements (whether a private trade school or a public one) and additional fees, including books, materials, and equipment.

Other determining factors include program length (the longer the program takes to complete, the more cost accumulates), program specialization (specialized programs require more expensive materials), and accreditation, among others.

## **Financial Aid for California Trade Schools**

Thanks to several financial aid initiatives for trade schools in California, students can alleviate the average cost even further. Below are some of the most notable options to consider:

* Cal Grant C - The Cal Grant C provides trade school students in California up to $5,470 for financial assistance yearly. It is available to any resident of California.
* California Chafee Grant - The California Chafee Grant was designed to support students attending trade schools in California. It offers up to $5,000 annually to cover tuition, living expenses, and other fees.
* Golden State Education Training Grant - The Golden State Educational Training Grant helps individuals laid off due to COVID-19 restart new trade careers. The grant will cover their tuition and fees for specific trade school programs.
* California National Guard Education Assistance Award Program - This financial aid initiative is available to California National Guard members who wish to attend vocational schools to earn a certificate or an associate degree.
* Federal Pell Grant - On a federal level, vocational school students in California can apply for the Pell Grant, offering up to $6,895 annually.

Trade school students in California looking for more options may consult the [California Student Aid Commission](https://www.csac.ca.gov/) (CSAC) for more information.

## **Licensing and Accreditation for California Trade Schools**

One of the factors every student must look out for in a trade school is accreditation. Not only does it guarantee a specific educational standard and quality, but it also validates degrees and certificates. It paves the way for career growth and professional credentials.

The **WASC Senior College and University Commission** and **Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges** are two of California's main organizations responsible for accrediting colleges and post-secondary institutions. The former is in charge of accrediting four-year institutions, while the latter accredits two-year colleges.

State trade schools tend to look to the **Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges** for national accreditation. The **Distance Education Accrediting Commission** accredits online vocational schools in California.
