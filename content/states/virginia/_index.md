## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in Virginia**

The *Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges* is responsible for awarding regional accreditation status to trade schools in Virginia. Even though regional accreditation makes it easy to transfer credits from institution to institution, not all schools in the state pursue regional accreditation.

It is common, for instance, that a few private schools in the state pursue national accreditation, which the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges awards\*.\* As for online schools and programs, they are accredited by the *Distance Education Accrediting Commission*.

Candidates must ensure their prospective schools are accredited and registered with the state. Accreditation is not the same as registration/licensing.

The *State Council of Education for Virginia* maintains a list of approved public and private institutions (including trade and technical schools) in Virginia.
