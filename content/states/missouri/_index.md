## **Average Cost of Trade Schools in Missouri**

A trade school student in Missouri can spend as little as $17,000 on their overall education costs. However, it is also possible to spend as much as $35,000. The factors contributing to the disparity range from the profit orientation of the school (whether or not it's for-profit or non-profit), the size and variety of the programs offered, and, of course, its location within the state.

The length of a program will also play a part in determining how much it will cost to complete, seeing as longer programs tend to incur more costs along the way than shorter programs.

Lastly, other factors affecting trade school program costs in Missouri include the program's level of specialization, the school's accreditation status, and more.

**Analyzing the Total**

As mentioned above, the total cost of attending a trade school in Missouri ranges between $17,000 to $35,000. Contributing to this figure are various unit costs, including the tuition fees, which can range between $8,000 to $25,000, the student fees, which can range between $500 to $1,000, and programs-specific equipment, which can range from $500 to $5,000.

The cost of books and materials can also be as low as $500 or as high as $1,000. Considerations such as transportation costs, accommodation costs, and utility bills also contribute to the total cost of attending a trade school in Missouri.

## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in Missouri**

Of the various quality criteria for a trade school, accreditation should always be the first on the list. This is because accreditation sets the tone for other quality metrics.

For a trade school to be accredited, it has already met certain quality requirements set by accrediting agencies and commissions. Additionally, accreditation is important to allow students to access several scholarships and grants.

For candidates looking to confirm accreditation, the Higher Learning Commission is usually the agency to look out for when it comes to regional accreditation for trade schools in Missouri. The Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges is the relevant agency for national accreditation.

Online schools looking to become accredited must consult a different agency, the Distance Education Accrediting Commission.
