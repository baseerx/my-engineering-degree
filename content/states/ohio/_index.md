## **Average Cost of Trade Schools in Ohio**

As an aspiring trade school student in Ohio, many factors can contribute to exactly how much you'll spend to complete a training school program in the state. These include the following.

* Location - trade schools in urban areas are typically more expensive than those in rural areas. This is due to the cost of living and tuition fees.
* Specialty - Programs with a highly specialized focus will often require highly specialized equipment, which is typically more expensive than general ones.
* Duration - The duration of a program plays a significant role in determining its cost, as longer programs typically cost more.
* Accreditation - The accreditation status of a school/program also plays a role in its cost.
* Variety - Lastly, the more programs a school offers across various fields, the higher the education cost.

Providing a general value as a guide is possible with all these in mind. From our estimation, it costs around $5,000 to $12,000 to attend a public trade school in Ohio, while it costs $12,000 to $32,000 to attend a private trade school in the state.

This is according to figures obtained from relevant sources like the National Center for Education Statistics and specific programs offered by trade schools in the state.

The overall cost includes unit costs such as tuition, accommodation, transportation, books, utilities, and other relevant charges.

## **Financial Aid for Trade Schools in Ohio**

The above costs are significant. Still, thanks to several financial aid programs in the state, trade school students may reduce or eliminate them. Different financial aid programs have different requirements, with some initiatives having multiple requirements for varying levels of financial assistance.

Below, we explore some of Ohio's most popular financial aid programs for trade school students.

* ***The Ohio College Opportunity Grant*** - was created to support students in Ohio who are in financial need and planning to attend a public or private college. Candidates must be enrolled in an accredited school to qualify.
* ***Community Foundation of Shelby County Scholarships -*** offers varying financial support for up to 200 students annually. Current and aspiring trade school students may apply.
* ***OPRA Foundation*** - The Ohio Parks and Recreation Association (OPRA) Foundation awards up to three yearly scholarships for Ohio students attending a post-secondary program relating to parks, recreation, and leisure studies.
* ***Richland County Foundation Career Technical Education Scholarships*** - The Richland County Foundation Career Technical Education Scholarships offer varying levels of financial support to students in Richland County attending a trade or technical program. Candidates must be enrolled in an accredited school to qualify.

## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in Ohio**

The ***Higher Learning Commission*** is the agency responsible for the accreditation of trade schools in Ohio on a regional level. At the same time, the ***Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges*** is responsible for accrediting trade schools on a national level.

The ***Distance Education Accrediting Commission*** awards accreditation status to trade schools who are predominantly online. The particular accreditation to pursue depends on several factors, including the size of the school, whether it's for profit or not, and how specialized the degree is.

Along with accreditation, licensing is another important issue regarding trade schools. While regional and national bodies award accreditation, all trade schools must be registered with the state before operating legally.
