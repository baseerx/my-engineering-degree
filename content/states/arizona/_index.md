Individuals in Arizona looking to acquire in-depth knowledge and valuable skills in a specific trade will do well to consider attending a trade/vocational school. Unlike most traditional college programs, trade school programs focus on hands-on skills that prepare students to take on real-world duties quickly.

This is usually a perfect solution for candidates looking for fast-tracked options to launch successful careers. In Arizona, interested candidates can choose between a handful of high-quality vocational schools covering a wide range of lucrative programs.

Before securing admission into these programs, there are certain things that candidates must know, including the average tuition cost, supplementary fees, and possible financial aid. All of these and more are what we examine in the upcoming sections.​​​

## **Average Cost of Trade Schools in Arizona**

Arizona trade schools are relatively more affordable than regular universities and traditional colleges. That said, candidates should still be prepared to pay some fees, including tuition, tools, materials, and books.

Ultimately, the average cost of attending trade programs in Arizona will range between $6,000 to $18,000. Naturally, more advanced programs will need more specialized tools and training and edge closer to the $18,000 point, while those less specialized will edge closer to the $6,000 point.

Another factor that can influence the cost of a trade school program in Arizona is the duration. Programs that last longer will incur various fees along the way, accumulating over a larger period than those that can be completed faster.

Other factors to consider in this regard include the location within the state and the availability of financial aid. Programs located in areas with higher cost of living tend to be more expensive than others.

As for financial aid, this can cover part or all of the program costs. We dive deeper into possible financial aid solutions for students of trade schools in Arizona below.

## **Financial Aid for Trade Schools in Arizona**

Financial aid for trade school students in Arizona is available through state and federal initiatives. Students searching for federal grants may submit their FAFSA form to determine their eligibility.

They would also do well to confirm that their trade institution meets the requirements for such grants.

As for state options, candidates may consider the following sources for Arizona financial aid initiatives and scholarships:

* **Arizona Commission for Postsecondary Education (ACPE)** - The Arizona Commission for Postsecondary Education oversees various regulations and guidance for post-secondary institutions in the area. The commission also offers a handful of financial aid incentives for qualified students.
* **Arizona Community Foundation** - Candidates may also look to the Arizona Community Foundation, which regularly offers scholarships for qualified candidates every year.
* **Arizona State Government Scholarships** - Lastly, trade school students in Arizona looking for government scholarships may consult the Arizona state government websites to discover and apply for a series of financial grants and scholarships that are often made available by the state.

Candidates may also check in with their specific trade schools to see if grants are available in the department or through the financial aid office.

## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in Arizona**

There are several factors to consider when choosing a trade school in Arizona. However, accreditation is one of the most important criteria to look out for right from the start.

Accreditation ensures that institutions operate very highly, adhering to standards set by parties approved by either the state or federal government. One of Arizona's most prominent accrediting bodies for trade schools is the Higher Learning Commission, which grants accreditation status to four-year and two-year schools.

To operate in the state, private trade schools must also be approved by the ***Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education.***

Another commission of interest is the ***Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges***, which grants accreditation status on a national level. The ***Distance Education Accrediting Commission*** grants accreditation status to online schools.
