## **Licensing and Accreditation for Trade Schools in Rhode Island**

Before enrolling in a trade school program, candidates in Rhode Island are expected to confirm accreditation. They are expected to do this on two levels: the institutional accreditation confirmation and the programmatic accreditation confirmation.

Institutional accreditation confirmation means that the relevant agencies in charge of such affairs have accredited the school.

Currently, the ***New England Commission of Higher Education*** (NECHE) and the ***Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges*** are some agencies responsible for accrediting schools in Rhode Island. The difference, however, is that while the former is responsible for regional accreditation, the latter is responsible for national accreditation.

Programmatic accreditation means that the program offered by the school is also accredited. A school can be accredited, but some programs they offer still need to be accredited.

Both institutional and programmatic accreditation are important for easier employment, high educational standards, and access to financial aid.
