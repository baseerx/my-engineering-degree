Trade jobs are crucial to the success of any economy. Apart from the fact that they offer competitive salaries and opportunities for career growth, they are also appealing because they don't necessarily require a college or university education.

However, because so many occupations are considered blue-collar trade jobs, it can be challenging to choose among the available options, especially for those who don't have any frame of reference to filter by.

If you want to pursue a career in these fields but need help deciding which one is right, the list below should help. Here we have highlighted 15 of the most appealing and highest-paying trade jobs and a few notes on what makes them special.​​​​​​

## **What is a Blue-Collar Trade Job?**

Blue-collar trade jobs don't necessarily require a college or university education. This does not mean that those who aspire to pursue these professions cannot choose to go to college. They definitely can.

An advantage of apprenticeship programs over college programs is that apprenticeship programs, unlike college programs, tend to pair students with professionals who have already attained a higher level in the field so that they receive real-time training and supervision in a functional work environment.
