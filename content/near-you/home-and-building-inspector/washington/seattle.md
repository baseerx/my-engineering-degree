Home and building inspectors in Seattle, Washington, extensively analyze buildings and properties to determine if they meet the required standards. This involves examining various components from electrical, HVAC, and outdoor systems.

To conduct a thorough inspection, candidates must first acquire a deep enough understanding of these systems along with additional professional requirements of the field. For this reason, attending the right training program is a must for aspiring homes and buildings in the city.

## **How to Become a Home and Building Inspector in Seattle**

The first step in becoming a home and building inspector in Seattle is to fulfill the prerequisite requirements. Neither the city nor the state mandates any educational prerequisite, but employers and training courses tend to ask for a high school diploma or GED.

As specified by the Washington State Department of Licensing, the requirements are that candidates must receive 120 hours of classroom training instructions and complete field training involving 40 hours and 5 inspections.
