## **How to Become a Home and Building Inspector in Washington**

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to become a home and building inspector in Washington.

**Step 1: Prerequisites**

The state of Washington does not set a prerequisite for becoming a home and building inspector. However, it is common for inspection firms and training programs to ask for a high school diploma or GED and a clean background.

**Step 2: Training Programs**

Individuals interested in becoming home and building inspectors in Washington must complete a home inspector classroom course and field training.

**Classroom Training**

According to the [Washington State Department of Licensing](https://www.dol.wa.gov/), all training programs for home and building inspectors must include 120 hours of training instruction. It is only after graduating from such a program that an individual can proceed to acquire their state license.

**Field Training**

After the classroom part of their training has been completed, the next step for candidates is to complete field training for real-world experience. To do so, they must attend 40 hours of field training supervised by a licensed home inspector in the state.

The 40 field training hours must include 5 inspections and detailed reports on these inspections.

**Step 4: Home Inspector Examinations**

From here, candidates can take the home inspector examinations, which, in Washington, include two different exams â€” the Washington Home Inspector Examination and the National Home Inspectors Examination.

**Step 5: Employment**

After all the above requirements have been met, the next step is seeking employment in relevant companies. This can be multi-inspector firms or government agencies. Candidates may also proceed to establish their own LLC or sole proprietorship.
