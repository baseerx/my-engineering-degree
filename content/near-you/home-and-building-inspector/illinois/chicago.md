We have simplified this process by providing an extensive list containing only the area's top home and building inspection schools. Candidates will also discover some qualities to look out for in these institutions and how some make career growth and opportunities easier.

## **How to Become a Home and Building Inspector in Chicago**

In Chicago, as with most states, aspiring home and building inspectors must complete an approved training program before practicing legally and professionally. These programs, such as the ones listed below, are expected to include at least 60 hours of training.

From here, the next step is to acquire some real-world experience by completing mock home inspections under the supervision of licensed home inspectors. This qualifies candidates for the Illinois Home Inspector Licensing Examination organized by the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation.

Along with passing the examination, candidates must also pay a fee of $250 and submit an official application to the department before they can be officially licensed.

Candidates may submit their applications online or by mail.
