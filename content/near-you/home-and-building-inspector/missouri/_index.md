## **How to Become a Home and Building Inspector in Missouri**

Aspiring home and building inspectors in Missouri are expected to follow the steps below to start their careers on the right path.

**Step 1: Meet the Basic Requirements**

The basic requirements for becoming a home and building inspector in Missouri include being at least 18 years old, having a high school diploma or GED, and having a clean background with no criminal history.

**Step 2: Enroll in a Recognized Training Program**

All aspiring home inspectors in Missouri must enroll in a top-quality home inspection training course. Quality is important in this regard, as the best programs make it easier for candidates to launch their careers successfully.

Not only do they provide comprehensive training concerning key topics, but they also provide a direct pathway for students to network with other professionals and pursue credentials and certification.

The best training programs also prepare candidates for the most important step – passing the national examination.

**Step 3: Pass the National Home Inspector Examination**

Passing the National Home Inspector Examination is mandatory for all home and building inspectors across the country. This exam consists of 200 questions, 175 of which are scored.

It covers the key aspects of home inspection, including property and building inspection, findings and reporting analysis, professional responsibilities, and site review. To apply, candidates must pay a $225 fee.

Even though it is possible to retake the exam if unsuccessful the first time, candidates must wait for 30 days and pay an additional $225 every time they have to retake the tests.

**Step 4: Become Certified**

After completing the above steps, candidates are advised to pursue professional certification to give themselves a better chance of rapid career growth. We discuss further the possible certification organizations for home and building inspectors in Missouri below.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

Compared to most states, Missouri does not demand that home and building inspectors obtain a license before they start working professionally. All of the steps highlighted above are important because that is the standard expected by employers, customers, and the federal government — not the state or local governments.

Home and building inspectors in Missouri are also expected to purchase general liability insurance. They may also purchase errors and omissions insurance to protect themselves from unforeseen missteps.

As for professional certification, candidates may consider joining the International Association of Certified Home Inspectors (InterNACHI) for career opportunities.
