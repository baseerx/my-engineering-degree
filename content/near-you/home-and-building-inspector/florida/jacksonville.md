Home and building inspectors in Jacksonville, Florida, don't just ensure that structures are well-designed and safely built; they also use specialized equipment to verify subtle properties of a building that a regular examiner will probably entirely miss.

To be able to work with this equipment and carry out their duties at a high level, it is usually imperative for a home and building inspector to pass through a training program.

And since there are many options, deciding can sometimes be challenging. However, you don't have to worry because that's where we come in.

Below you'll find a comprehensive list of the best home and building inspector schools in Jacksonville and a few notes on why they are worthy of your time.

## **How to Become a Home and Building Inspector in Jacksonville**

To become a home and building inspector in Jacksonville, interested candidates must follow the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) guidelines.

The guidelines state that aspiring home and building inspectors must complete a pre-licensing course with 120 hours of instruction before continuing to sit for any of the 4 approved examinations.

These examinations include the following:

* National Home Inspector Examination,
* Florida Home Inspection Examination,
* Florida Home Inspector Licensing Examination and the
* Certified Home and Property Inspector Examination.

Completing any of these qualifies candidates to move on to the next step: obtaining insurance and sending in their application forms. Licenses must also be renewed every year through 14 hours of continuing education.
