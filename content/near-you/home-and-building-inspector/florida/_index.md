## **How to Become a Home and Building Inspector in Florida**

The steps involved in becoming a home and building inspector in Florida are similar to those needed in most states, with a few exceptions.

We take a look at all of these below.

**Step 1: Possess a High School Diploma or GED**

Aspiring home and building inspectors in Florida must endeavor to get their high school diplomas or GED equivalent. This is needed to secure employment in a training program and also to become licensed down the road.

**Step 2: Enroll in a Training Program or Acquire Training on the Job**

Inspectors have to be trained to do their jobs. In some states, aspiring inspectors with prior experience in the construction field may opt to get their training on the job. In contrast, those without previous experience may train in a ***formal training program.***

In Florida, however, the state mandates that all aspiring inspectors undergo a pre-training licensing course before they are allowed to practice professionally.

**Step 3: Complete a Pre-License Course**

Home and building inspectors in Florida have to be licensed to practice. To do so, they must sit for and pass an approved exam. They must complete a pre-license course with at least 120 hours of training instructions to apply for this exam.

The Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) approves several online and offline courses. Still, each focuses on the same topics: home structure, interior and exterior components, roof covering, HVAC, and electrical systems, among others.

**Step 4: Select an Approved Exam**

After finishing the pre-licensing course, candidates must pass an exam to become licensed. The DBPR allows candidates to choose between four options in this regard. These are:

* **National Home Inspector Examination** - Offered by the Examination Board of Professional Home Inspectors ([EBPHI](https://nationalhomeinspectorexam.org/about-ebphi/#:~:text=About%20EBPHI,for%20the%20home%20inspection%20profession.)), this exam includes 200 multiple-choice questions and must be completed in 4 hours.

Candidates must sit for the exam in person. Examination fee varies by state.

* **Florida Home Inspection Examination** - Offered by the Florida Association of Building Inspectors (FABI), this exam includes 100 multiple-choice questions and must be completed in 2 hours.

The exam is available nationwide but must be taken offline at a proctored testing lab.

* **Florida Home Inspector Licensing Examination** - The Florida Home Inspector Licensing Examination is offered by the International Association of Certified Home Inspectors ([InterNACHI](https://www.nachi.org/exams/online-inspector-exam)) and consists of 120 random questions from a pool of 360 multiple-choice questions.

The exam is available to members and non-members of the association.

* **Certified Home and Property Inspector Examination** - This exam is available through the Association of Construction Industry Certified Professionals (ACICP). The exam must be completed in two hours.

**Step 5: Obtain Insurance**

The DBPR also stipulates that all home inspectors in the state must be insured before obtaining their licenses and practicing professionally. Each inspector in the state must have commercial general liability insurance for at least $300,000.

## **State License and Certifications**

Once all the above steps are completed, candidates must only finish their application and pay the appropriate fees to be licensed. To finish the application, candidates may either submit their forms through the online portal or print out the application and have it delivered by mail.

Among other things, the application form must include proof of education and proof of examination. As for licensing fees, the exact figure tends to vary based on the application method.

Lastly, candidates must also complete a background check, including fingerprint verification, through a LiveScan provider.

Licensing must be maintained on July 31 every year through 14 hours of continuing education and renewal fee payment.
