During their 70-hour training, candidates must learn everything they need to pass the National Home Inspectors Examination. They are also expected to undergo field training and carry out 25 inspections under the supervision of a licensed home inspector in the state.

The National Home Inspectors Examination includes 200 questions that must be completed in 4 hours. Candidates can retake the exam by paying another $225 examination fee.

Lastly, candidates must apply to the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation to acquire a valid home and building inspector license.
