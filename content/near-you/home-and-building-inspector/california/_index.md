Home and building inspectors in California inspect houses to ensure their condition is well within the required standards. Of course, “required standards,” in this case, can vary depending on the exact purpose of the inspection.

Below, we look at some of the considerations an aspiring home and building inspector in California must make to fulfill these requirements.

## **How to Become a Home and Building Inspector in California**

The following are the steps to becoming a home and building inspector in California.

**Step 1: Complete a Training Course**

To become familiar with the job's demands and the guidelines, all aspiring home and building inspectors in California are expected to attend a training program. While choosing a program, it is important to select an approved program, some of which we highlight below.

Candidates seeking additional flexibility may also go for online options.

**Step 2: Pass the National Exam**

After completing a training course, candidates must pass the National Home Inspectors Exam to acquire an additional layer of qualification. Even though it is not compulsory, the national exam is highly respected by realtors, clients, and fellow home and building inspectors, allowing fresh candidates to set themselves apart.

The exam deals with three general home and building inspection areas, including property inspection/site review, report analysis and findings, and specialist responsibilities.

**Step 3: Secure Employment**

After passing the National Home Inspectors Examination, candidates may apply for positions in relevant establishments.

It is also possible for individuals to start a small business, carrying out home and building inspection activities under their business name.

Individuals must register a limited liability company or a sole proprietorship business to do so. Aspiring home and building inspectors looking to start their own business must possess strong marketing and networking skills to build up their client base.
