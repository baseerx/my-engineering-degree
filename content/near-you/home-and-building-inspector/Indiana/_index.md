**Step 1: Complete 60 Hours of Classroom Training**

The first step to becoming a home and building inspector in Indiana is to complete 60 hours of training in the classroom.

Of course, this doesn't necessarily have to be an offline training room. In fact, many programs designed to help candidates meet this requirement are often set up as online programs.

Along with 60 hours of classroom training, candidates looking to become home and building inspectors in Indiana must also complete 12 hours of field training. Typically, this is where they will practice what they have been taught during the classroom aspect of their training.

Additionally, it is common for training programs such as the ones listed below to provide both classroom training and the opportunity for students to fulfill the field training requirements.
