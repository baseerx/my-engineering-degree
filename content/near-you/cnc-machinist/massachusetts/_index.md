## **How to Become a CNC Machinist in Massachusetts**

Below are the key steps required to become a CNC machinist in Massachusetts.

**Step 1: Meet the Basic Requirements**

Employers and training institutions typically set the basic requirements for becoming a CNC machinist in Massachusetts. These destinations typically require a high school diploma or GED and proficiency in a few basic topics in mathematics, physics, and computer science.

**Step 2: Enroll in a Training Program**

Students seeking training as aspiring CNC machinists may go through academic training or "on the job." Both are valid avenues with different pros and cons.

**Academic Training**

Several post-secondary schools in Massachusetts allow candidates to register for CNC machine training. These programs vary in length, but all have what it takes to give candidates the right career starting point.

In an academic CNC machine program, students focus on key theoretical concepts. Some schools also allow students to work with actual CNC machines.

Even though academic training is enough to secure employment, candidates may consolidate what they've learned with on-the-job training arrangements.

**On-the-Job Training**

A few training programs are designed to allow candidates to learn "on the job." Professional organizations that assign students to specific companies within the state offer many.

Here, they may learn everything they need to start their careers while working. Even though on-the-job training avenues may not be considered actual employment in some cases, they may also offer students the opportunity to make some income as they learn.

**Step 3: Resume & Employment**

After completing their training, CNC machinists in Massachusetts may create a sound resume and apply for open positions. To make their resume even more impressive, they may pursue professional certification opportunities, the most prominent of which we look at below.

However, they may earn professional credentials to improve their credibility and appeal. Several options are available in this regard, but the most popular are those offered by the National Institute for Metalworking Skills.

The institute offers credentials, including Certified CNC Lathe Programming Setup and Operations, CNC Milling 1, Manufacturing Technician Level 1, and Certified Metalworking Fluids Specialist.
