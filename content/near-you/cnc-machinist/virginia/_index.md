## **How to Become a CNC Machinist in Virginia**

The following steps are needed to start a career as a CNC machinist in Virginia.

**Basic Educational Requirements**

Future CNC machinists in Virginia must have a high-school diploma or GED. They are also expected to be familiar with the career duties of a machinist and some of the specialty areas involved in the profession.

Typically, CNC machinists are divided into three categories: operating machinists, setup machinists, and programming machinists.

**Preparatory Courses**

Aspiring CNC machinists in Virginia are also expected to prepare by refreshing their knowledge of relevant topics such as algebra and trigonometry. They may also take preparatory courses in technical drafting and blueprint reading.

**Academic Training**

Community colleges and trade schools around the area offer top-quality CNC machining training programs. Candidates can earn a certificate or a diploma depending on how comprehensive they want their training to be.

Acquiring a bachelor's degree through programs focusing on more comprehensive manufacturing topics is also possible. Candidates may spend 10 months and 4 years passing through an academic program in CNC machining.

The best programs incorporate both classroom training and real-world experience.

**Hands-On Training**

Acquiring hands-on experience working with CNC machines is critical for an aspiring CNC machinist. While most quality college programs have laboratories where candidates can work on such machines, some tend to prefer enrolling in an apprenticeship program for even more comprehensive hands-on training.

Individuals who want the best of both worlds (having the degree and classroom training that comes with academic programs while also enjoying the real-world experience offered by apprenticeship programs) can choose to combine both training avenues.

Apprenticeship programs typically last for four years.
