Aspiring CNC machinists in Arizona may consider the pathways below to start their careers.

**The Prerequisites**

The prerequisites to become a CNC machinist in Arizona involves:

* Having a high school diploma or GED,
* Becoming familiar with the duties and specializations in the field and
* Taking preparatory courses.

A high school diploma or GED is needed to secure admission into a training program. Understanding the duties and specialization beforehand ensures that candidates are well-prepared.

Preparatory algebra, trigonometry, blueprint reading, and computer science courses will also give candidates an edge over their fellow students once they secure admission into a viable training program.

**Training Programs**
