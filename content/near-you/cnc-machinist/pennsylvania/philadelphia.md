If you are a resident of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with a love for working with machines and operating complex instruments, a career as a CNC machinist is a very exciting one to consider.

There is abundant demand for CNC machinists in Philadelphia, and thankfully, many institutions offer high-quality training as well.

Along with technical training, the best programs also imbibe intangible skills such as safety consciousness and problem-solving skills in their students. We look below at some of the top schools in and around the city.

## **How to Become a CNC Machinist in Philadelphia**

The first step in becoming a CNC machinist in Philadelphia is enrolling in a training program. These training programs have a handful of requirements, such as the provision that candidates must be high school graduates with a diploma or have a GED equivalent in place.

Those who want to avoid going through an academic training program may acquire training on the job.

One of the benefits of acquiring on-the-job training is that sometimes, they make provisions for students to earn while they learn.

Training programs in academic institutions such as colleges and trade schools also have advantages, as they provide a very structured learning environment and certification opportunities (which can make employment easier).
