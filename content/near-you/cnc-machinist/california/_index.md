## **How to Become a CNC Machinist in California**

The following are all the steps you need to go through to become a CNC machinist in California:

**Prerequisites**

Before becoming a CNC machinist in California, aspiring professionals must be high school graduates with a diploma or a GED.

They must also be familiar with the duties of a CNC machinist and their areas of specialization.

**Educational Routes**

As a prospective CNC machinist in California, two educational routes are available for you. The first is to go through the academic route, while the second option is to complete a CNC machinist apprenticeship program.

* **The Academic Route** - A prospective CNC machinist in California can go through an academic program in a community college or Technical School. While pursuing a certificate can take less than a year, those who enroll in associate degree programs will have to spend two years to complete their journey.
* **The Vocational Route** - Hands-on training on the job is essential for a CNC machinist. For this reason, many choose to complete an apprenticeship program to acquire a mix of theoretical and practical knowledge.

Along with actually getting their hands on CNC machines, apprenticeship programs also teach students essential safety practices and computer-aided design.

**Become Certified**

Before securing employment, CNC machinists are often advised to acquire additional credentials to make themselves more employable. We discuss more about licensing & certification for CNC machinists in California later in the article.

**Secure Employment**

Lastly, once all of the above steps have been fulfilled, the next step to becoming a CNC machinist in California is to apply for employment in your industry of choice. As a CNC machinist, you can work in engineering, defense, aerospace, automotive, shipbuilding, and oil and gas.
