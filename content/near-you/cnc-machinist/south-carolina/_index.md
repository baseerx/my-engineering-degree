## **How to Become a CNC Machinist in South Carolina**

To become a CNC machinist in South Carolina, individuals must go through the following steps:

**Step 1: Fulfilling Prerequisite Requirements**

The state of South Carolina doesn't mandate CNC machinists to possess any basic educational requirements. This prerogative is down to the employers who usually ask that candidates must at least have a high school diploma or GED. As we'll see below, more than having either of these is often required.

**Step 2: Understanding Areas of Specialization**

To begin a career as a CNC machinist, it pays to understand how the occupation works beforehand. And a large part of understanding how the occupation works is becoming familiar with the different areas of specialization.

To that end, the three specialty areas a CNC machinist can work in are below.

* **Operating machinist** - in charge of using CNC machines and ensuring they function as they should.
* **Set-up machinists** - in charge of setting up, monitoring, and maintaining CNC machines to ensure they can run smoothly when called upon.
* **Programming machinist** - a programming machinist writes and maintains the code that programs computers. They can also tweak and update the code to adapt to scale and various feature needs.

**Step 3: Enrolling in a Training Program**

Most of what a CNC machinist does is hands-on training. However, they can still enroll in a college training program to receive an in-depth understanding of the theoretical aspects of the occupation.

A CNC machinist who wishes to get started as fast as possible may enroll in a certificate program that can be completed in months. At the same time, those looking to get a comprehensive education may consider the two-year associate degree program or a four-year degree program.

**Step 4: Obtaining Hands-on Experience**

As mentioned above, hands-on experience is critical for a CNC machinist. For this reason, even after receiving training at a formal program, most CNC tend to work as apprentices under the mentorship of established and experienced machinists to gain the real-world experience they need before branching out independently.

Combining formal school training with apprenticeship programs is possible to acquire a more "complete" form of exercise. Those who wish to do this usually enroll in a certificate training program with fast-tracked coursework and then spend the rest of their time acquiring hands-on training.

## **State Licensure and Certification Requirements**

South Carolina has no special licensure requirements for a CNC machinist. As long as they can obtain proper training and perform their jobs at a high level, they're free to practice professionally wherever needed.

But even though licenses aren't required, certifications often come in handy. Many CNC machinists have become certified not because it is the law to do so but because certification usually indicates to employers that they can do their jobs at a high level and take the profession seriously.

Certification also makes it possible to keep improving on the job through continuing education, often a criterion to renew and maintain these credentials.

One of the most popular certification options for a CNC machinist is the credential offered by the National Institute for Metalworking Skills (NIMS).
