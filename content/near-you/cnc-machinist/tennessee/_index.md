## **How to Become a CNC Machinist in Tennessee**

Individuals interested in starting a CNC machining career in Tennessee may consider the steps below to launch their careers.

**Step 1: Have a High School Diploma or GED**

The most fundamental educational requirement needed to become a CNC machinist in Tennessee is a high school diploma or GED. In high school, candidates must focus on mathematics, algebra, geometry, blueprint reading, technical drafting, and computer science.

**Step 2: Enroll in an Academic Program**

A CNC machining academic program allows candidates to learn the fundamentals of CNC machine operations, general blueprint reading, and technical topics. Most importantly, they will graduate with a certificate or a degree and be equipped with all the necessary skills to secure employment.

Even though enrolling in an academic program is not mandatory, many choose to because the degree or certificate acquired helps secure employment and pursue continuing education.

**Step 3: Acquire Hands-On Experience**

Like most occupations, hands-on experience is important for a CNC machinist. And even though academic programs try to incorporate elements of hands-on training, the best place to obtain one is through an apprenticeship program.

For this reason, some consider apprenticeship programs a viable alternative to academic programs. Others consider it a complementary avenue to consolidate the skills obtained from colleges and trade schools.

Those with prior experience in related fields may apply directly for a job and acquire training while working.

**Step 4: Put your Skills Together and Secure Employment**

Finally, candidates can put their resumes together and seek employment in relevant industries. They may also acquire a certification to verify their skills and make themselves more appealing to potential employees.
