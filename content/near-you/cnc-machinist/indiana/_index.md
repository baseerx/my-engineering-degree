## **How to Become a CNC Machinist in Indiana**

Here are the considerations all aspiring CNC machinists in Indiana must make to get their careers properly started.

**Meeting the Basic Requirements**

In Indiana, a high school diploma is the first basic requirement to become a CNC machinist. Those who don't have a high school diploma may opt to use a GED equivalent.

Additionally, some training programs may ask that candidates must be at least 18 years old and have a solid understanding of basic topics in mathematics and physics.

**Obtain Relevant Training**

Aspiring CNC machinists in Indiana may obtain training from an academic, apprenticeship, or other programs offering on-the-job training.

* ***Academic Program***—Community colleges, trade schools, and technical institutions across the state offer robust training to produce new batches of CNC machinists. These programs typically take around 36 weeks, but some can be quicker or more extensive.

While such programs focus on classroom training and theoretical principles, they include enough hands-on training to ensure graduates are well-prepared.

* ***On-the-Job Training***—Individuals looking to obtain even more hands-on training may take advantage of apprenticeship programs offering on-the-job training.

**Certification and Employment**

The state of Indiana only asks CNC machinists to obtain professional credentials before they can begin their careers and secure employment. However, with some certifications, an aspiring CNC machinist's resume will look much better.

Below, we discuss the possible certification alternatives these professionals should consider.

There are many options regarding certification. However, the National Institute for Metalworking Skills is the most prominent organization. What's more, the Institute doesn't offer just one option.

Candidates may choose between a handful of options highlighting their areas of specialization. Some examples include the Certified CNC Lathe Programming Setup and Operations, CNC Milling 1, Manufacturing Technician Level 1, and the Certified Metalworking Fluids Specialist certification.
