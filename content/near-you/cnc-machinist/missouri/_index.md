A CNC machinist can operate, troubleshoot, repair, program, and manage CNC machines. They differ from CNC operators and technicians because they fully know the machine and its processes.

This way, they can do more than operate the device; they can also go farther. In Missouri, CNC machinists are in high demand, and according to projections, this demand is about to get even higher.

If you're interested in starting a career in this field, you have come to the right page. Below, you'll find everything you need to know to do so successfully.

You'll discover the process's key steps, the best training destinations, and the certification possibilities. You will also find out what possible starting salary to expect and how to scale your earnings.

## **How to Become a CNC Machinist in Missouri**

The following are the steps involved in becoming a CNC machinist in Missouri.

**Step 1: Meet the Minimal Requirements**

Many companies that employ CNC machinists usually require that they obtain training. Some, however, may offer training opportunities with the caveat that candidates must at least possess a high school diploma or GED.

It is also common for training programs to welcome only those at least 17 years old and have a strong knowledge of basic mathematics and physics.

**Step 2A: Academic Training**

CNC machinists tend to obtain training from an academic program organized by a community college or trade school. These programs boast structured environments and highly qualified instructors.

Among other things, students will learn how to operate and set up CNC machines while being able to monitor the speed and feed of the devices. They will also learn design principles, particularly computer-aided design.

Academic training for CNC machinists may take varying amounts of time to complete, with the average training duration being 9 months.

**Step 2B: Acquire Training on the job**

Candidates who want to avoid attending a community college or wish to learn at work will likely prefer the apprenticeship training route. This is possible thanks to companies and employers who allow their entry-level staff to keep learning on the job.

Acquiring training on the job is perfect for candidates with prior experience in computer-based manufacturing.

**Step 3: Certification**

Becoming certified can help a CNC machinist stand out from the competition. Employers love it, and it also allows professionals to improve themselves through networking and continuing education.

We will discuss certification options for CNC machinists in Missouri later in the next section.

**Step 3: Secure Employment**

After completing all the above steps, candidates may highlight all their qualifications on a resume and start applying for open positions.

## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

Missouri, like most states around the country, does not require compulsory licensure for CNC machinists. This means that candidates must follow the above steps, and they may start their careers immediately.

The same principle applies to certification. Candidates are not mandated to receive one and can start their careers without it. However, to reap the professional benefits of these credentials, most CNC machinists choose to obtain one anyway.

Currently, the *National Institute for Metalworking Skills* is the most prominent organization responsible for issuing professional credentials to CNC machinists in Missouri. The Institute offers a *Certified CNC Lathe Programming Setup and Operations* certification that professionals and employers across the country well respect.
