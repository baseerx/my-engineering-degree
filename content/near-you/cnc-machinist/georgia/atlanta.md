Becoming a CNC machinist requires the development of several operator skills to handle various computer numerical control machines. CNC machinists need to know how to program these machines, troubleshoot them, and set them up when called upon.

Attending a CNC machine technology training program is the best way to obtain these skills. As an aspiring CNC machinist in Atlanta, Georgia, you'll be glad to know that there are numerous worthwhile programs in and around the city to consider.

We look at some of the top options below and the attributes that make them stand out.

## **How to Become a CNC Machinist in Atlanta**

Like most states, Georgia requires a high school diploma or GED as the primary educational requirement for aspiring CNC machinists. For this reason, individuals in Atlanta must first fulfill this requirement before they can apply for a training program.

Regarding actual CNC machine training, academic programs usually offer a more structured learning environment and a degree upon graduation. In contrast, apprenticeship programs provide intensive hands-on training, real-world familiarity, and mentorship.

Choosing between an academic program and an apprenticeship program is up to individual preference, but combining both forms of training can optimize the learning experience.
