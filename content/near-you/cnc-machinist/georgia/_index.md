CNC machines make use of a technology known as computer numerical control to manufacture exact and accurate tools efficiently.

It is usually up to a CNC machinist to ensure this automated process runs smoothly and optimally. They can also customize the process conditions through programming while troubleshooting any issues.

To become a CNC machinist in Georgia, all candidates must follow a handful of general steps and a few steps peculiar to only CNC machinists in the state.

We discuss these in the sections below, providing educational and certification alternatives for those who want to try something different.

## **How to Become a CNC Machinist in Georgia**

The following are the steps involved in becoming a CNC machinist in Georgia:

**High School Diploma**

In Georgia, as in most locations nationwide, CNC machinists are expected to have a high school diploma before securing admission into a training program. Those who don't have a certificate may make use of their GED results in its place.

**Academic Training**

CNC training programs offered by community colleges and trade schools are the first option to consider for aspiring CNC machinists. These programs teach students about computer-aided design, CNC programming, and types of CNC machines, including milling machines, routers, plasma cutters, and CNC lathes.

**On-the-Job Training**

Those who don't want to attend an academic program may choose instead to obtain training on the job. Below are the most common routes in this regard:

**Apprenticeship**

Apprenticeship programs organized by government, private academies, and certification bodies are great at teaching students the fundamentals of CNC machine technology hands-on.

These programs take a few years to complete and sometimes offer job placement assistance upon graduation.

**CNC Machinist Assistant**

Instead of going through an apprenticeship program, CNC machinists with little experience on the job may apply for a trainee position and learn their duties on the job.

**Continuous Learning, Specialization & Professional Organizations**

After completing a training program and securing employment, CNC machinists are encouraged to continue improving their skills through continuous learning and specialization. This, along with joining professional organizations, can significantly boost job prospects and average salary.

## **State Licensure and Certification Requirements**

Georgia does not have a general licensing requirement for CNC machinists practicing within its borders. Instead, professionals in the field are advised to pursue certifications from prominent professional organizations. Doing so provides more recognition between peers and employers while opening the door for career growth.

The [National Institute for Metalworking Skills](https://www.nims-skills.org/news/2009-02-16/731) offers CNC Machining level 1 and 2 credentials for CNC machinists just beginning their careers.

The institute also offers an Industrial Maintenance credential and a Metalforming credential for additional specializations.

## **Top CNC Machinist Schools in Georgia**

The following are some notable CNC machinist training programs in Georgia for interested candidates to consider.

**Georgia Tech**

Georgia Tech offers a CNC pathway initiative introducing students to various aspects of CNC machining and computer-aided manufacturing. Students of the program are instructed not only in theoretical machining topics but also in hands-on workshop operations.

As stated on the program page, the classes aim to give students a structured and consistent approach to learning about CNC machines and various software packages.

**Atlanta Technical College**

Atlanta Technical College offers a Machining Technology program to bring up new batches of skilled machinists. Students are taught how to set up different types of CNC machines and use precision instruments and computer-aided design/ manufacturing. They will also be prepared to sit for recognized certification and licensure examinations.

**North Georgia Technical College**

[North Georgia Technical College](https://northgatech.edu/academic-programs/industrial-technology/) is another incredible destination for high-quality CNC machining training. The school's Precision Machining program is on its Clarksville campus and includes classroom and hands-on instructions.

Students can also choose between an associate degree, diploma, or certificate. The program lasts between 2 to 5 semesters, depending on the degree in sight.

Topics include print reading for machine tools, CNC mill and lathe, and hands-on operation techniques.
