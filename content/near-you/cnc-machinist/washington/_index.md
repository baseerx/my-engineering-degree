## **How to Become a CNC Machinist in Washington**

Below are the key steps to start a CNC machining career in Washington.

**Step 1: Become Familiar with the Field**

It is possible to become familiar with what the field of CNC machining entails without necessarily having acquired knowledge to practice as a CNC machinist. Aspiring CNC machinists in Washington are advised first to become familiar with some of the areas of specialization in the field and the expected general duties.

Typically, professionals in the field specialize as operating machinists, setup machinists, or programming machinists.

To enroll in training programs, candidates may also take preparatory courses in algebra, trigonometry, and blueprint reading while having their high school diploma or GED equivalent ready.

**Step 2: Enrolling in a Training Program**

The second step in becoming a CNC machinist in Washington is acquiring the necessary skills. To do so, a candidate must enroll in a training program.

Generally, candidates often choose between attending a college/trade school program, an apprenticeship program, or combining both in one form or another. Combining them can be a good way to go, as both have pros and cons.

Academic programs are very structured and offer either a certificate or a degree. They also have workshops and laboratories where candidates can acquire some hands-on training. Apprenticeships, on the other hand, focus heavily on real-world experience.

**Step 3: Deploy Your Skills**

To finally put their skills to work, fresh CNC machinists in Washington may assemble a resume and send them to viable destinations. Some potential establishments to seek employment include equipment manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, shipbuilders, and medical companies.
