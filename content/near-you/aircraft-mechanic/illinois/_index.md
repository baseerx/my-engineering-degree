## **How To Become an Aircraft Mechanic in Illinois**

Below are all the steps involved in becoming an aircraft mechanic in Illinois:

**The Prerequisites**

Training programs, the FAA, and sometimes even employers will not admit candidates who do not meet the basic conditions for being an aircraft mechanic. These primary conditions include being at least 18 years old, fluent in English, and qualifying for the FAA examination criteria.

**Qualifying for the FAA Examination**

The FAA stipulates three conditions that aspiring aircraft mechanics must meet before they can sit for the Airframe and Powerplant examination (which they will need to secure employment).

These conditions include:

* graduating from an accredited training program,
* having at least 18 months of work experience in a civilian organization, or
* having work experience at a military organization.

For those who would like to go through the accredited training program route, you will be glad to know that there are a lot of high-quality FAA-approved institutions in Illinois.

For those who would like to go through the work experience route, the 18 months requirement is only enough to sit for either one of the Airframe or Powerplant rating tests. You must accrue up to 30 months of work experience to sit for both.

**Passing the FAA Examination**

Once you meet the requirements above, the next step is to pass the examinations.

The tests are divided into oral, written, and practical sections. And candidates must complete all three areas for the Airframe and Powerplant ratings.

In total, each rating takes 8 hours to complete.

**Securing Employment**

Lastly, once you're done with the examination, you may secure employment in the establishment of your choice. Aircraft mechanics can work as maintenance technicians, supervisors, and managers.
