## **How To Become an Aircraft Mechanic in Chicago**

Earlier, we mentioned that one of the most important steps to become an aircraft mechanic in Chicago is to enroll in an approved training institution. While this remains true, it is not the only possibility available to interested candidates.

Those who do not wish to enroll in a formal training program can choose instead to acquire training on the job. Those who do so must work under the supervision of a licensed aircraft mechanic for at least 18 months before they can become licensed themselves.

Military personnel who have experience in the field may also apply to take the licensure test. Generally, however, for most people, going through an approved training program remains the most popular alternative.
