One of the most challenging parts of becoming an aviation mechanic is choosing the right pathway to follow. Usually, most people become professionals in the field by completing an accredited apprenticeship or official training program.

Both options are valid and recognized by the FAA.

It is also possible to become an aviation mechanic by going through the military route. Either way, regardless of the path you choose, there are a few key pieces of information that you should have before you begin to pursue a career as an aviation mechanic in Texas. You will find all of these key details more rigorously explained in the sections below.

## **How To Become an Aircraft Mechanic in Texas**

The path toward becoming an aircraft mechanic in Texas includes rigorous training. But all things considered, it is still a pretty straightforward one.

The objective is to become certified by the FAA and secure a job at a respectable establishment, but before that, you must attend an approved training program where you'll obtain all the necessary skills and technical know-how needed to succeed on the job.

From there, you may go on to officially apply for certification with the FAA and take the appropriate tests and examinations required. Usually, most aviation mechanics pursue a career as Airframe and Powerplant Mechanics and then work their way up toward other specialties in the field or pursue something else related to the aviation industry.

* Must be able to read, write, and speak English,
