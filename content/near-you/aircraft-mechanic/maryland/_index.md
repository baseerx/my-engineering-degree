It is natural to thank a pilot after a successful flight and show gratitude for their effort. And while pilots do play an indispensable role in the aviation industry, other less popular professionals are just as deserving of appreciation.

Among these groups are aircraft mechanics, who maintain and repair critical aircraft systems to ensure continual operation and safety. Thanks to the highly technical nature of their jobs, becoming an aircraft mechanic is usually quite the achievement.

If you happen to reside in Maryland and want to pursue a career in this field but have no idea how to go about it, below is a detailed step-by-step guide that should teach you everything you need to know about becoming an aircraft mechanic in Maryland.

## **How to Become an Aircraft Mechanic in Maryland**

Becoming an aircraft mechanic in Maryland involves acquiring specialized skills and certification. Below is the most recommended pathway to achieve this goal.

**Step 1: Meet Eligibility Requirements**

Anyone looking to become an aircraft mechanic in Maryland must first meet some basic requirements. For starters, they must be at least 18 years old. Otherwise, they must obtain a license to practice supervision.

Secondly, they must speak, read, and write English proficiently, as the licensing and certification tests will be administered in English.

**Step 2: Aircraft Mechanic Specialization**

All aircraft mechanics are trained to perform routine checks and maintenance on aircraft parts, but they specialize further. Below are some of the most common categories:

* ***Aircraft mechanic*** - "aircraft mechanic" usually covers general, entry-level technical roles in aviation maintenance. Available aircraft mechanics usually proceed to obtain certification as airframe and powerplant (A&P) mechanics.
* ***Airframe and powerplant (A&P) mechanics -*** This is one of the most common designations for aircraft mechanics. It is reserved for those certified in two ratings - the airframe (A) and powerplant (P). Aircraft and powerplant mechanics can supervise other technicians.
* ***Avionics technician*** - This designation is reserved for aircraft mechanics who deal with navigation equipment, autopilot systems, radio, and entertainment systems.
* ***Inspection Authorized (IA) mechanics*** - Inspection Authorized Mechanics are in charge of directing maintenance and conducting annual aircraft maintenance as specified by the FAA.
* ***Aviation investigator*** - Aviation investigators are employed by the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board) to investigate aircraft incidents.

**Step 3: Obtaining Training**

Regardless of which specialization you have in mind, you have first to acquire the necessary training to become an aircraft mechanic. Most goals are to sit for and pass the airframe & powerplant oral and practical exams.

You may get the necessary training and experience needed to do so in one of three ways:

**Civilian Experience**

Civilians who have worked at an FAA repair station or FBO, and have been supervised by a certified mechanic for up to 18 months for either the Airframe (A) or powerplant (P) certificate or 30 months for both, can get certified by the FAA and become aircraft mechanics.

**Military Experience**

Becoming an aircraft mechanic by joining any armed service and acquiring expertise and experience in aircraft maintenance is also possible. To qualify, candidates must ensure they work in a military occupational specialty, to which the FAA gives credit.

**FAA-Approved Mechanic Training School**

Lastly, as an alternative to both options, you can attend an FAA-approved aviation maintenance technician school in Maryland or anywhere in the country. You may take the certification exam once you graduate and meet the other requirements.

**Step 4: Certification & Licensing**

You don't necessarily need a license to practice as an aircraft mechanic if you work under certified people. To be able to practice without supervision and advance in your field, you must get certified.

Certification requires that the following conditions be fulfilled:

* President must be at least 18 years old and speak, write, read, and understand English.
* Candidates must have at least 18 months of practical experience for either certification or 30 months for both.
* Candidates must have graduated from an FAA-approved aviation maintenance technician school (AMTS), completed the training course for military personnel, or obtained training directly from an FAA repair station.
* Candidates must also know Title 14 of the [Code of Federal Regulations](https://www.faa.gov/exit/?pageName=%2814+CFR%29+part+65%2C+subpart+D%2C+Mechanics&amp;pgLnk=https%3A%2F%2Fecfr.io%2FTitle-14%2FPart-65%2FSubpart-D).

Having met the above requirements, candidates must sit and pass the written, oral, and practical tests. They must do this for either the Aircraft (A) or Powerplant (P) ratings, or both to be referred to as Aircraft and Powerplant (A&P) mechanics.

## **Top Aircraft Mechanic Schools in Maryland**

The following are some of the top FAA-accredited schools for future aircraft mechanics in Maryland to consider.

**Major Anderson Tuskegee Aviation Maintenance Academy**

Major Anderson Tuskegee Aviation Maintenance Academy is a nonprofit aviation school in Maryland that provides airframe and powerplant training on critical standards and fundamentals.

The airframe program is comprised of 12 credits, while the power plant program is comprised of six credits. The critical focus topics in both programs include power and control systems, airframe structures, inspection and assembly, power plant theory, and more.

**Pittsburgh Institute of Aeronautics**

Pittsburgh Institute of Aeronautics' Hagerstown campus is an FAA-certified airframe and powerplant training institution. The school is run by Hagerstown Airport Authority, allowing students to immerse themselves in the real world while learning theoretical concepts.

Participants of this program can look forward to modern classrooms and quality learning resource systems. For instance, the school boasts a modern computer laboratory and specialized shop areas.

Candidates will become familiar with aircraft propulsion systems, hydraulics, instruments, composite materials, and more.

The program lasts for a 16-month diploma, after which graduates will earn a certificate and be adequately prepared for the airframe and powerplant exams.

Classes take place every weekday between 8 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.
