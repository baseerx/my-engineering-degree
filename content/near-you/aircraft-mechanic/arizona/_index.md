## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

Once you're done with the training and education aspect of the process, the next step to becoming an aviation mechanic is to become certified officially.

One thing that's worth noting in this regard is that, unlike most professions, certification for aviation mechanics or aviation maintenance technicians is not carried out by any particular state body but by the FAA.

Now the FAA specifies two distinct ratings for certifying aircraft mechanics. The first is the Airframe (A) rating, while the second is the Powerplant (P) rating. It is possible to get certified for both ratings at once. This is usually referred to as an A&P certificate.

Among other things, to become A&P certified, you must be 18 years old, be able to read, write and speak English, and must have gone through a recognized training program as highlighted earlier.

## **Salary and Job Outlook**

Aspiring aircraft mechanics in Arizona can look forward to earning a salary of around $67,113 every year. Entry-level professionals who are just starting out may fall a little short of this number and end up with a salary of around $45,328.

But with time, they can look forward to surpassing even the average salary and earn as high as $99,370.

Along with the base salary, aircraft mechanics also enjoy perks such as paid time off, tuition reimbursement by companies, retirement plans, health insurance, 401k, and vision insurance, among other things.
