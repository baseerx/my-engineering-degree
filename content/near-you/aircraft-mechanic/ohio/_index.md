Aircraft mechanics play a vital role in the aircraft industry. Without them, planes would be regularly grounded without the possibility of a fast repair, and most of us won't be able to get to where we need to be as quickly, consistently, or conveniently.

To obtain the knowledge and expertise they need to carry out their jobs at the highest possible level, there are a few requirements an aspiring aircraft mechanic must meet. Only after all of these requirements have been met and additional steps completed can an aircraft mechanic be certified by the FAA.

Below we have provided multiple sections containing all the information you'll need to know to get started as an aspiring aircraft mechanic in Ohio. We look at critical aspects of the job, such as the educational, licensing, and certification requirements, along with the potential salary to look forward to.

## **How to Become an Aircraft Mechanic in Ohio**

The following are the steps needed to become an aircraft mechanic in Ohio:

**Meet the FAA Prerequisites:**

The FAA prerequisites for aspiring mechanics are simple: be at least 18 years old, and be fluent in English. This includes reading, writing, and speaking the language to a very high level. These are the prerequisites before the main requirement, obtaining adequate training/real-world experience.

**Enroll in a Training Program:**

To receive their training, aspiring aircraft mechanics can attend a training program or obtain their activity on the job.

Most people choose to go for the former simply because it gives them access to solid classroom instructions, which usually come in handy when it's time for the written part of the Airframe and Powerplant license tests.

Many of the best training programs will also have state-of-the-art facilities and aircraft upon which students can practice what they are taught.

To be valid, the FAA must accredit an aircraft mechanic training program.

**Obtain Training on the Job:**

Candidates who wish to refrain from enrolling in a training program can obtain their training on the job. To qualify for either the Airframe (A) or Powerplant (P) licensing tests, they must have been working under the supervision of a licensed aircraft mechanic for at least 18 months.

They must have at least 30 months of experience to sit for both rating tests. The same goes for military personnel who have learned their duties on the job.

**Take the FAA Airframe & Powerplant Ratings Tests**

The FAA Airframe & Powerplant Ratings Tests focus on 43 topics and must be completed within 24 months. Each rating has oral, written, and practical tests that take around 8 hours to complete.

The FAA is the licensing or aircraft mechanics. The steps above are everything you need to obtain your license and start practicing professionally. The Administration also stipulates that aircraft mechanics must renew their licenses every two years to remain valid.

They must do this by working at least 1000 hours within the past couple of years and completing 16 hours of additional training within the same period.
