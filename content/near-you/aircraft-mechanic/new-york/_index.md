## **How to Become an Aircraft Mechanic in New York**

The following are the steps needed to become an aircraft mechanic in New York:

**Meet the Prerequisites**

All aircraft mechanics in New York must be at least 18 years old and able to write, speak, read, and understand English. These are the prerequisites always requested by training institutions, the Federal Aviation Administration, and sometimes employers.

**Enroll in a Training Program**

To become an aircraft mechanic, individuals must either obtain training on the job or through a formal educational program.

Candidates who wish to obtain their aircraft mechanic training from a training program must do so in an institution approved by the FAA.

As you'll see below, there are several of these programs in the state of New York to consider. They offer quick graduation times and in-depth instructions for passing the FAA tests in both rating categories.

**Obtain Training on the Job**

Candidates who wish to obtain their training on the job can also do so, but they must accrue at least 18 months of work experience before they can sit for either of the Airframe (A) and Powerplant (P) rating tests.

Those who want to sit for both tests can do so by accruing 30 months of work experience.

**Take the FAA Airframe & Powerplant Ratings Tests**

Lastly, candidates can sit for either the Airframe (A) tests, Powerplant (P) tests, or both after training. The test will include 43 technical subjects and must be completed within 8 hours. You can find more information on the [FAA Airframe and Powerplant website](https://www.faa.gov/mechanics/become).
