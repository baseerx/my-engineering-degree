While a pilot has to get an aircraft from one point to another, even experienced pilots sometimes find it challenging to diagnose critical issues with a plane. Thankfully, there is a group of professionals whose duty is to be familiar with every crucial component of an aircraft and be able to diagnose when something is wrong. These professionals are none other than aircraft mechanics.

In Washington, aircraft mechanics earn an impressive annual average salary and usually have an easy time securing employment. Below, we look at everything it takes to start a career in the field as a resident of Washington.

## **How to Become an Aircraft Mechanic in Washington**

The process of becoming an aircraft mechanic in Washington can be broken down into a few steps. We discuss all of them in detail below.

**Step 1: Understand the Basic Requirements**

Along with being at least 18 years old, the basic requirements of starting an aircraft mechanic career in Washington include being proficient in English and having a solid high school foundation in physics, electricity, mathematics, and other related topics.

**Step 2: Understand Specialty Areas**

Generally, there are two specialty areas in aviation maintenance technology. These are the Airframe (A) and Powerplant (P) specializations. The airframe specialization involves the overall construction of an aircraft, while the powerplant specialization focuses on engines and fuel systems.

While it is possible to take certification exams in only one specialty area, it is common for aircraft mechanics to focus on airframe and powerplant specializations.

**Step 3: Choose a Training Option**

As an aspiring aircraft mechanic in Washington, you can choose between two training options. The first is to acquire your training through an accredited training program that can take 18 months to 24 months to complete.

Such training programs are popular in the state, and we highlight a few alternatives in an upcoming section.

Another option is to go through the real-world experience route by acquiring training on the job. You may need to work for 18 or 24 months, depending on whether you pursue one or two specializations.

**Step 4: Pass the FAA Examinations**

The [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/) makes available training materials for both certification exams through its official aviation maintenance technician web page. Of course, those who have attended accredited training programs would have been prepared for these exams throughout their stay.

**Step 5: Apply for Jobs**

After completing the above steps, candidates may apply for jobs at pertinent establishments. Professional organizations such as the Professional Aviation Maintenance Association make networking and discovering job opportunities easier.

## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

The only relevant certification and licensure for aviation maintenance technicians is the one offered by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This means that candidates in Washington do not have to be concerned with any particular state body.

The FAA exams are divided into knowledge written tests, oral tests, and practical tests. Those pursuing Airframe (A) and Powerplant (P) specializations must conduct these tests in both areas.

Subsequently, after securing employment and practicing professionally for three years, aircraft mechanics in Washington may also obtain the *Inspection Authorization* designation to carry out advanced repairs and run aircraft repair stations.
