## **How to Become an Aircraft Mechanic in Tennessee**

Below are the key considerations involved in becoming an aircraft mechanic in Tennessee.

**Choose a Training Option**

The first significant step in becoming an aircraft mechanic in Tennessee is to choose your training route. According to the FAA, candidates can qualify for certification by attending an accredited program or obtaining training on the job. It is also possible to prepare for the credential exams by completing a military personnel training program.

**Accredited Training Programs**

Most accredited training programs take between 18 and 24 months to complete. They usually focus on subjects such as electricity, physics, aircraft operation, technical drawings, fuel systems, and turbine engines.

**On-the-Job Training**

On the other hand, to qualify through on-the-job training, candidates aiming for one specialization certification must acquire 18 months of work experience. Those who are going for both specializations must receive 30 months of experience.

**Military Personnel**

Military personnel may also qualify for the FAA certification exam without following the abovementioned steps. Instead, they must only complete the Joint Service Aviation Maintenance Technician Certification Council training course.

**The FAA Certification Exams**

The FAA's certification exams include an oral and practical knowledge test session. The knowledge session includes written questions about general aviation mechanics, airframe, and powerplant standards. The oral test is practically an interview by a designated mechanic examiner. Lastly, candidates must also complete a practical test where they will showcase their acquired skills.

**Securing Employment**

After completing the steps above, aspiring aircraft mechanics in Tennessee may go on to create a resume and start applying for jobs. Individuals may increase their chances by joining professional organizations such as the [Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association](https://www.amfanational.org/) or the Professional Aviation Maintenance Association.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

In Tennessee, aspiring aircraft mechanics are not expected to register or receive a license from any state board. Only a permit from the Federal Aviation Administration is required to start applying for jobs. Candidates will receive their airframe and powerplant licenses once they complete the three aspects of the FAA exams.

After spending three years on the job, candidates may also choose to acquire the *Inspection Authorization* credential. This will give them the authority to carry out advanced aircraft inspections and approve significant repairs.

Candidates with the IA certification can also operate aircraft repair stations.
