## **How to Become an Aircraft Mechanic in Pennsylvania**

Below are the steps involved in becoming an aircraft mechanic in Pennsylvania.

**Step 1: Ensure that You Meet the Basic Requirements**

The main step in becoming an aircraft mechanic is passing the Federal Aviation Administration's airframe and powerplant exams. Before you can even think of sitting for this exam, however, you must be at least 18 years old.

The FAA also specifies that candidates must be able to speak, read and write the English language fluently.

**Step 2: Educational Requirements**

The FAA specifies two distinct approaches to taking the Airframe and Powerplant licensing examination. The first is the training approach, while the second is the experience approach.

Those with experience on the job will do well to consider the training option. This involves applying for admission into an accredited training program.

Luckily, as we'll see below, there are quite a few options in and around the state to consider.

**Step 3: Experience Requirements**

You don't have to graduate from a training program before you can sit for the Airframe and Powerplant test. The FAA allows those with prior experience receiving training on the job to also sit for the exams.

Before they can sit for both rating tests, however, they must have accrued 30 months of supervised work experience. Military personnel who have also worked for the same time may also register for the tests.

Candidates who wish to sit for only one of the Airframe and Powerplant rating tests can do so with just 18 months of work experience.

**Step 4: Passing the Tests**

Lastly, once you qualify, the next step is to sit for and pass the FAA tests. The tests are divided into oral, written, and practical aspects. They cover around 43 technical subjects.

Candidates must pass all of the tests within 24 months. Usually, tests for just one certificate take around 8 hours to finish.
