## **How to Become an Aircraft Mechanic in Philadelphia**

An aspiring aircraft mechanic in Philadelphia must have it as their sole objective to sit for and pass the FAA Airframe and Powerplant rating tests. This is because aircraft mechanics, regardless of their state, are licensed only by the FAA, and this is only possible by passing the above tests.

The FAA has specified three broad criteria to qualify for these tests to make things easier for candidates. The first is that candidates must have worked in a military capacity, and the second must have experience learning on the job and practicing in a civilian organization. The third is that they must have graduated from an FAA-approved training program.
