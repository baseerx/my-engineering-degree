Aircraft mechanics are the unsung heroes of the aviation industry. While they may not get as much exposure or praise as pilots and aeronautical engineers, they nonetheless carry out a highly crucial role that includes making sure that aircraft are in absolutely perfect condition for flight.

Of course, to do their jobs at a high level, aircraft mechanics must first attend a training program. In fact, thanks to the rules laid down by the Federal Aviation Administration, it is virtually impossible for anyone to become certified as an aviation mechanic in Florida without first obtaining training either through an accredited program or an apprentice.

## **How To Become an Aircraft Mechanic in Florida**

So to become an aviation mechanic in Florida, and indeed everywhere else in the country, you need to attend a training program. But is that the only step required? Well, no.

Along with obtaining training, an aspiring aircraft mechanic must also become certified, and, in certain cases, choose a specialty.

When it comes to choosing a specialty there are about four options. These include working as an Airframe and Powerplant (A&P), Avionics Technician, Inspection Authorized (IA) mechanic, or Aviation Investigator employed by the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board).

## **Top Aircraft Mechanic Schools in Florida**

Below are some of the most notable aircraft mechanic schools in Florida:

**1\. Broward College**

111 East Las Olas Blvd Fort Lauderdale, Florida

[Broward College](https://www.broward.edu/) often finds its way to the top of any list involving the most prominent aircraft mechanic schools in Florida and for good reasons too. Apart from having a knowledgeable and experienced group of instructors and beautiful facilities, the school also holds itself to a very high standard of education.

Their aviation maintenance technician program is strictly full-time, but classes are available at various times of the day. Of course, the program is approved by the FAA, and graduates may proceed to take the FAA's oral and written Airframe and Powerplant rating tests.

**2\. Atlantis Flight Academy**

1602 Southwest 77th Avenue, Pembroke Pines, FL 33023

Atlantis Flight Academy in Pembroke Pines has produced more than its fair share of successful aircraft mechanics over the years. It does so through its comprehensive program and respected faculty members.

Some of the most notable areas of concentration in the coursework include wing repair and maintenance, propellers, brakes, pneumatics and hydraulics, avionics, and of course, electrical and mechanical systems diagnostics.

**3\. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University**

600 South Clyde Morris Blvd Daytona Beach Florida

The Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University is a popular aeronautical institution with branches all across the nation. The Florida branch is located in Daytona Beach and boasts all the state-of-the-art equipment and facilities one would expect from a prominent aviation training institution.

Students often express satisfaction with how much hands-on training is involved. As expected, the school is FAA-approved and graduates automatically qualify to sit for the oral and written airframe and powerplant tests.

**4\. National Aviation Academy**

6225 Ulmerton Road, Clearwater, FL 33760

As one would expect, the National Aviation Academy is licensed by the FAA in the two prominent aircraft mechanic ratings (Airframe and Powerplant). Students get to learn in a wonderful environment with enough facilities to truly highlight a lot of the most important topics in a hands-on manner.

Another highlight of the program is its relatively fast pace. Students get to complete their entire coursework in a matter of 14 months, which is significantly faster than most programs. In total, the entire training duration encompasses a total of 2,000 clock hours.

## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

Certification for aircraft mechanics is handled by the FAA. Once aspiring aircraft mechanics complete their appropriate training programs, they may proceed to take the Airframe and Powerplant tests administered by the FAA.

Technically, these are two separate ratings. The Airframe (A) rating is considered by the FAA to be different from the Powerplant (P) rating. But both are combined in the A&P certificate.

Graduation from an approved aviation mechanic school or military training course qualifies candidates to sit for the certification tests, which include three components - the written test, the oral test, and the practical test.

Candidates can find helpful test standards and results on the official FAA [website here](https://www.faa.gov/mechanics/become).

## **Salary and Job Outlook**

Aircraft mechanics in Florida earn a median annual salary of $78,793. This is around the same as the expected national average for other states in the country. Of course, your salary may end up being higher or lower than this figure depending on a handful of factors, including experience, establishment, and location.

Those who fall into the lower spectrum of earners usually take home around $52,027 per year, while those in the top ten percent earn as high as $119,261.

The highest-paying cities include Tampa, with an average annual salary of $99,575, Orlando, with $86,900, Fort Lauderdale, with $86,684, Key West, with $82,733, and Stuart, with $79,031.
