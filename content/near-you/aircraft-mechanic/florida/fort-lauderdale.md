It is no secret that to become an aircraft mechanic in Florida, you would need to acquire the necessary fundamental training as specified by the FAA. To do so, you would have to attend an FAA-approved aviation mechanic school near you.

Thankfully, there is no shortage of approved institutions that offer a high level of training that will not only help you pass the FAA tests but ensure that you're able to perform your duties on the job to a high level.

Below we have provided a comprehensive list of such schools in Fort Lauderdale, ensuring to include key information such as available courses, duration, tuition, and admission requirements, along with other relevant details.

## **What to Look for in an Aircraft Mechanic School**

Before we look into individual schools and programs, it is important to iterate some of the things you should look out for in an aircraft mechanic school in the first place. The first and most important of these is the accreditation status.

Any aviation maintenance technician school that you'll be attending should be approved by the FAA. Without the approval, it would be impossible to sit for the certification tests that will qualify you to start practicing as an aircraft mechanic.

Additionally, you want to ensure that the school you enroll in has enough equipment for practical sessions, provides hands-on experience, and is committed to a high standard of education.

We have ensured that all of the entries below fulfill these requirements.
