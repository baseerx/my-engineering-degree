## **How to Become an Aircraft Mechanic in South Carolina**

The following is a step-by-step breakdown of the requirements to become an aircraft mechanic in South Carolina.

**Choose a Specialty**

Before you train as a future aircraft mechanic in South Carolina, choosing a specialty or becoming familiar with the options is advisable. Currently, these include:

* Choosing the Airframe (A) specialty to work on an aircraft's frame,
* Choosing the Powerplant (P) specialty to work on the engines and inner systems,
* Choosing the Airframe (A) and the Powerplant (P) ratings for an A&P certification.

**Choose a Specialty**

Before enrolling in a training program, candidates may want to choose a specialty, either the Airframe (A) specification or the Powerplant (P) specification. Those who don't like choosing will also be glad to know they can choose both trainings.

**Complete a Training Program**

During training, candidates must acquire technical knowledge of theoretical concepts while becoming familiar with actual aircraft parts through hands-on training.

Furthermore, the best training programs ensure that candidates are well-prepared for the upcoming FAA examinations. Usually, these can be completed in 18 months (for one rating specialty) and 24 months (for both A&P ratings).

**Pass the Licensing Examinations**

Candidates who have graduated from FAA-accredited training will qualify for the licensing examinations. These exams include written, oral, and practical aspects for Airframe and Powerplant candidates.

Those who successfully pass the exams may consider themselves licensed aircraft mechanics.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

Aircraft mechanics in South Carolina do not have to worry about registering with a state body or passing a state regulatory examination to start their careers. The FAA is the only body responsible for overseeing the licensing and registration of aviation maintenance technicians and aircraft mechanics across the state.

The steps above are typically more than enough to meet the FAA licensing requirements. Military candidates may also pass through the military route by attending a training program on base.

Lastly, career growth is possible for an aircraft mechanic in South Carolina through the Inspection Authorized certification. This credential allows them to run their plants and oversee highly advanced maintenance and repair projects.
