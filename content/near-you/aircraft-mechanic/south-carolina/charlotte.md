Aspiring aircraft mechanics in Charleston, South Carolina — as with all other cities in the country — must follow the guidelines laid down by the Federal Aviation Administration to begin their careers. While these guidelines have many key facets, the most important is that students must attend an accredited training institution.

For students in Charleston, identifying these programs may be a challenge. Thankfully, that is where the following list comes in.

Here, we explore the top accredited training programs for aspiring aircraft mechanics in Charleston, their key features, and why they deserve your attention. Before we begin, however, let us quickly touch upon the general steps needed to launch an aircraft mechanic career in Charleston, SC.

## **How to Become an Aircraft Mechanic in Charlotte**

In Charlotte, aspiring aircraft mechanics must have a high school diploma or GED to secure admission into a training program.

When choosing a training program, attending one the FAA approves is mandatory. With FAA approval, program quality is easier to ascertain, and it is also possible to qualify for the FAA certification examinations.

Only those who pass these exams can go on to practice in a process capacity. The exams are divided into oral, written, and practical aspects for the Airframe (A) and Powerplant (P) specification ratings.

While candidates can choose either of these ratings as their sole specialization, they can also obtain training and pass the FAA examinations in both ratings.
