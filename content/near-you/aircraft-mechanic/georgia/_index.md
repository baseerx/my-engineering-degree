## **How to Become an Aircraft Mechanic in Georgia**

The steps involved in becoming an aircraft mechanic in Georgia can be grouped into three categories. These include:

* Meeting the Prerequisites
* Qualifying for the FAA Examination
* Passing the FAA Examination

**Meeting the Prerequisites**

Candidates who wish to become aircraft mechanics must be at least 18 years old. This is according to the laws laid down by the Federal Aviation Administration.

They must also be able to read, write and speak the English language fluently.

**Qualifying for the FAA Examination**

To qualify for the FAA examination, you must go through one of three routes:

**Accredited Training Program**

The FAA certifies a handful of training programs all over the country to train aspiring aircraft mechanics and teach them all the skills they'd need to pass the Airframe (A) and Powerplant (P) examinations.

The best programs have modern facilities and aircrafts for students to practice the things they are being taught.

**Civilian On-the-Job Training**

Civilians who have learnt how to become an aircraft mechanic under the supervision of a licensed mechanic can also sit for the Airframe and Powerplant ratings tests without having to attend a formal training program.

They can do so as long as they have up to 30-hours of supervised work experience. Those who wish to sit for only one of the Airframe (A) or Powerplant (P) ratings tests can do so with just 18 months of experience.

**Military On-the-Job Training**

Lastly, military personnel who also have supervised work experience totaling up to 30 hours also qualify to sit for the licensing tests.

**Passing the FAA Examination**

The FAA examination for aircraft mechanics consists of oral, written, and practical sections. The tests for each rating can be completed in about 8 hours.

After passing the FAA examinations, individuals can then go on to secure employment in their establishment of choice.
