Wisconsin is home to many successful aircraft mechanics and several companies that hire these professionals. Moreover, the state also boasts several top-quality training institutions where interested candidates receive robust training to start their careers on the best possible path.

However, just because the framework for a successful career has been laid down doesn't mean that candidates usually take advantage of it. Some may need help discovering the optimal path and the destinations most suitable for their career journeys.

To that end, we have provided below a comprehensive guide detailing all the key requirements for an individual in Wisconsin to start a successful aircraft mechanic career.

## **How to Become an Aircraft Mechanic in Wisconsin**

Below are the steps required to start a successful career as an aircraft mechanic in Wisconsin.

**Prerequisites**

To become certified as an aircraft mechanic in Wisconsin, candidates must fulfill a handful of basic requirements. These include having a high school diploma or GED, being at least 18 years old, being able to read, write, and speak English fluently, and passing through an accredited training program.

**Choosing a Training Program**

Training programs for aspiring aircraft mechanics in Wisconsin are responsible for teaching students the technical subjects they'll need to secure employment and perform their duties at a high level. The best programs usually involve much hands-on training to stimulate a real-world work environment.

It is also imperative that students choose only those training programs offered by the Federal Aviation Administration.

**The FAA Examination**

Candidates can only become a licensed aircraft mechanic in Wisconsin or anywhere else in the country if they pass the FAA examinations. Thankfully, training programs do their best to ensure that graduates are always ready to pass the examination.

Candidates must be prepared to take a written test, an oral interview, and a practical skills test in which they will work with actual components.

Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the airframe and powerplant specifications are distinct, and both require different oral and practical tests.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

Once candidates complete all the above steps, they may officially become an aircraft mechanic in Wisconsin. Once they're done with the training leg of the process, the next critical step is to become officially certified by the appropriate body.

One thing worth mentioning in this area is that, unlike most trade and technical professions, certification for aviation mechanics/maintenance technicians is not carried out by any particular state body in Wisconsin but by the Federal Aviation Administration.

Candidates also have a choice between the FAA's two distinct ratingsâ€”the Airframe (A) rating and the Powerplant (P) rating. Of course, it is also possible to not choose and instead get certified for both ratings simultaneously, usually referred to as an A&P certificate.
