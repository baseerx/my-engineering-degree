Finding a high-quality trade/vocational school remains one of the most critical steps any aspiring HVAC technician in Texas must take. There are many benefits to being an HVAC technician in Texas, but these will most likely only be possible with proper training.

Luckily, there is plenty of HVAC technician training programs in Texas. And of these, a lot are of a high enough standard to be considered among the best in the country. Recognizing and filtering the best from the rest can be challenging, but you don't have to worry - because that is where the list below comes in.

Here you'll find some of Texas's best HVAC technician training programs, all vetted for quality and comprehensiveness.

## **How to Become an HVAC Technician in Houston**

Aspiring HVAC technicians in Texas often consider one of two options when starting their careers. The first option is finding employment with only a high school diploma or GED. This way, all the skills and knowledge they'll need will be acquired on the job.

While this approach is the fastest, it is usually much harder to secure employment this way, and those who do most likely will earn a reasonable salary once their training is complete.

On the other hand, those who wish to have an edge over fellow technicians often go through a formal training program before seeking employment.

Lastly, HVAC training and apprentice program graduates must register with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation before practicing professionally.
