## **How to Become an HVAC Technician in South Carolina**

The following steps are needed to become an HVAC technician in South Carolina.

**Step 1: Acquire Training**

The most important step to becoming an HVAC technician in Colorado is to acquire appropriate training. Candidates sometimes choose to do so at a trade school or community college.

Here, they'll learn crucial topics in the classroom, possibly through hands-on training through workshops and real-world projects. Some may also partner with professional organizations for more immersive hands-on training.

It is common for these programs to ask that candidates have at least a high school diploma or GED.

**Step 2: HVAC Apprenticeship**

Trade unions and professional HVAC organizations help bring up new batches of HVAC technicians in South Carolina by running apprenticeship programs across the state. These programs teach students all the key fundamentals by allowing them to work with tools and actual HVAC components as quickly as possible.

Most apprenticeship programs are very comprehensive, with some taking as long as 4 years to complete. Candidates typically enjoy direct job placement thanks to the connections made during training.

**Step 3: Specialization, Credentials, & Employment**

To stay above the competition, fresh HVAC technicians in South Carolina may consider specializing and obtaining professional credentials from nationally recognized professional organizations. We discuss more on this particular topic in the upcoming section.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

HVAC technicians in South Carolina are expected to obtain a license, but only after the start of their careers. Candidates who begin as entry-level workers can be licensed if they work under someone already licensed.

However, when they seek to branch out on their own, candidates must obtain an HVAC contractor license issued statewide. This license can be obtained either through the ***Contractors Licensing Board*** or the ***Residential Builders Commission*** â€” both of which fall under the ***South Carolina Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation.***

Certification is optional for HVAC technicians in South Carolina, but professionals can obtain one from the ***Municipal Association of South Carolina***.
