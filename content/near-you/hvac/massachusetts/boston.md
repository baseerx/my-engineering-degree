A career as an HVAC technician is often desirable for its security, growth potential, and excellent median salary. While HVAC technicians are regarded as the go-to person for installing and fixing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system issues, they do much more than just repairs and installations.

HVAC technicians are also needed to maintain these systems, ensure they remain in the best shape for as long as possible, and even in some cases, develop ways to improve on existing components.

To do this to the highest level, of course, requires a great deal of training and specialized education. For this reason, anyone looking to pursue a career as an HVAC technician must first get familiar with educational options and requirements.
