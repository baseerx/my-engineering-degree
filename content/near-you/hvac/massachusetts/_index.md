HVAC technicians are known for repairing, maintaining, and in some cases, improving the functionalities of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. Because they have to work with complex systems that most people need a natural understanding of, HVAC technicians must acquire specialized training and, in some states, obtain specific licenses before they can practice.

If you'd like to consider a career as an HVAC technician in Massachusetts, below is a step-by-step guide on everything you need to know, including educational prerequisites, possible educational paths, available programs, and potential salary in the state.

## **How to Become An HVAC Technician in Massachusetts**

Most HVAC technicians follow the same broad framework throughout their careers. This includes the following steps:

**Step 1: High School Diploma**

Due to the technical nature of the job, it is usually only possible to become an HVAC technician by first enrolling in a program. And to enroll in a training program, applicants must show proof of a high school diploma.

Anyone who doesn't have a diploma may offer a GED in its place. Those who already envisage a career in the field from high school may choose to get a head start by attending a vocational school.

Those in regular high schools may also attain the same edge by taking courses geared towards mechanical aptitude.

**Step 2: HVAC Technician Training Program**

Once an applicant has obtained a high school diploma or GED, completing an HVAC technician training program is next. There are a few options, each with varying completion times and certificate types.

**Certificate Program**

The first option is to go with a certificate program. The advantage of this approach is that it takes the least time to complete, and you can proceed to get certified as fast as possible. Certificate programs take ten months to complete and focus on HVAC-related topics and skills.

**Associate's/Bachelor's Degree**

Other HVAC technicians choose to attend a college program instead. The advantage of this approach is that you leave with an associate's degree (if you opt for a 2-year program) or a bachelor's degree (if you opt for the 4-year program).

College programs are known to be more robust in their curriculum, often incorporating other general education courses. Also, college degree programs usually come with more work opportunities upon completion.

**Step 3: Apprenticeship**

While apprenticeships are not mandatory for all HVAC technicians, many employers in Massachusetts prefer their employees to have one, thanks to the valuable on-the-job skills and experience they provide.

These apprenticeship programs last 3 - 5 years and are usually provided by trade unions and associations. Some programs are advanced enough to replace certificate/degree programs completely.

**Step 4: Getting Licensed**

There are three licensing categories for an HVAC technician in Massachusetts, depending on the type of systems you specialize in. These include the refrigeration licenses for those who work with ten tons of refrigeration, the EPA license for working with refrigerants, and the NATE license for working with heating and cooling systems.

## **HVAC Technician State Licenses & Certifications**

Below is more detail on the three license requirements category for HVAC technicians in Massachusetts.

**Refrigeration License**

The state mandates a refrigeration license for those who work with ten or more tons of refrigeration. The refrigeration license has three categories: the refrigeration apprentice license, the refrigeration technician license, and the refrigeration contractor license.

The refrigeration apprentice license is for those enrolled in registered apprenticeship programs, while the refrigeration technician license is for those with at least 6000 hours of apprenticeship experience in Massachusetts.

The refrigeration contractor license is for those who have worked at least 2000 hours as refrigeration technicians.

**EPA Section 608 Certification**

Despite the varying state requirements for HVAC technicians, one certification requirement is mandated by EPA in all states. This is the Section 608 Technician Certification which allows technicians to work with refrigerants.

This certification comes in three levels: Type I, Type II, and Type III. Each has its unique exam consisting of 25 questions. Candidates must answer 18 of these correctly to pass.

**NATE License**

The North American HVAC industry founded the National Association of Testing and Evaluation license. This license demonstrates that an individual can work on heating and cooling systems.

## **Top HVAC Technician Schools in Massachusetts**

Aspiring HVAC Technicians in Massachusetts may consider the following schools for comprehensive curriculum and high-quality training.

Students who enroll full-time will complete their training in nine months and automatically qualify for a handful of certifications, including the EPA safety certification. They will also graduate with a certificate and relevant skills needed to secure employment.
