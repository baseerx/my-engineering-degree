## **How to Become an HVAC Technician in Ohio**

**Basic Requirements**

As with most states, Ohio HVAC technicians must be at least 18 years old before they can apply to training programs and for their licenses.

It is also a common requirement among these institutions to ask the candidates to have their high school diploma or GED ready along with official transcripts.

**Training Options**

To become an HVAC technician in Ohio, interested applicants usually have two options regarding their training. The first is to enroll in a formal training program, while the second is to consider attending an apprenticeship program.

Combining both approaches is possible by completing a formal training program and then spending a few months in an apprenticeship program (instead of the standard four years).

**Formal Programs**

Formal training programs offer comprehensive classroom and hands-on training for aspiring technicians in the state. These programs leverage their array of experienced instructors and state-of-the-art facilities to prepare students for their duties once they secure employment and for the certification and licensing exams.

**Apprenticeship Programs**

Apprenticeship programs, just like formal training programs, combine some classroom training with hands-on training. But unlike traditional training programs, apprenticeship training programs focus heavily on real-world training under the supervision of experienced professionals.

Many prefer apprenticeship programs thanks to the emphasis on hands-on training and the mentorship they tend to get from the instructors and union.
