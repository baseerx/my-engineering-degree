## **How to Become an HVAC Technician in Illinois**

**Step 1: High School Diploma or GED**

HVAC technicians in Illinois have two training alternatives to consider on their path to becoming practicing professionals in the state. But before then, it is usually advisable to possess at least a high school diploma or a GED.

This makes admission easier regardless of the training option chosen.

**Step 2A: Formal Training**

The first possible alternative to becoming an HVAC technician in Illinois is to go through a formal training program offered by a college or vocational school. Even though it's not mandated by law, most choose to do so because it provides a standardized environment to learn the fundamentals of the field before moving on to the real world to practice what has been taught.

Additionally, employers tend to look favorably at candidates with some form of formal training.

**Step 2B: Apprenticeship**

Enrolling in an apprenticeship program is the second possible alternative to becoming an HVAC technician in Illinois. This is possible because the state of Illinois still needs to have advanced degree requirements for its HVAC technicians.

Unions and local associations offer apprenticeship programs that can be completed in 3 to 5 years.

**Combination Programs**

Aspiring HVAC technicians who wish to get the best of both worlds can acquire formal training at a vocational school and training from an apprenticeship.

Those who have completed a vocational school usually spend less time in an apprenticeship program and would have acquired a complete education by the time they're done with both.
