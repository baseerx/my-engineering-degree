## **How to Become an HVAC Technician in Florida**

Becoming an HVAC technician in Florida usually involves following the key steps below:

**Step 1: Finish High School**

Florida rarely specifies an absolute minimum education requirement for HVAC technicians. But it is usually a common requirement among trade schools, apprenticeships, and companies to request that candidates at least possess a high school diploma or GED equivalent.

**Step 2: Acquire Training from your Institution of Choice**

Training is the most important aspect of becoming an HVAC technician. For candidates in Florida, there are two main options to consider — to apply for an apprenticeship program or enroll in a trade school/college program.

* **Applying for an Apprenticeship Program -** The state allows certain trade unions, organizations, and companies to run apprenticeship training programs to build up upcoming HVAC technicians. These programs usually run for a few years and focus on providing real-world, hands-on training and mentorships.
* **Enrolling in a Trade School Program** - Trade schools and colleges in Florida have impressive HVAC technology programs wherein students are trained on foundational topics in heating, cooling, and air ventilation systems.

Unlike apprenticeship programs, formal training programs often focus on classroom training before incorporating hands-on training in the real world.

To enjoy the best of both worlds, candidates may spend time in a formal training program before enrolling in an apprenticeship.

**Step 3: Apply for a Contractor License**

Florida has four distinct classes of HVAC licenses. These are Class A State Certified Contractor, Class B State Certified Contractor, Class A State Registered Contractor, and Class B State Registered Contractor.

HVAC technicians must obtain at least one of these licenses before being allowed to practice professionally.
