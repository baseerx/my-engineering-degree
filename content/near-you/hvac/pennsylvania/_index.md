## **How to Become an HVAC Technician in Pennsylvania**

HVAC technicians in Pennsylvania have to follow the steps below before they can be allowed to practice professionally:

**1\. Obtain a High School Diploma or GED Equivalent**

Every HVAC technician in Pennsylvania needs a high school diploma or GED before securing employment. Technically, no minimum educational requirement is set by the state's laws.

However, trade programs, apprenticeships, and employers can request at least a high school diploma or GED equivalent.

**2\. Enroll in a Training Program**

HVAC technicians in Pennsylvania, like most states in the country, can choose to acquire their training while working in an actual HVAC work environment through an apprenticeship program.

Those who would like to acquire training first before working, they can do so by applying for a formal training program at a college or vocational school.

**Apprenticeship or Trade School?**

As one would expect, there are benefits to be gotten from either approach. The hands-on training approach allows one to become familiar with the actual work environment from the start.

On the other hand, training programs focus on facilitating a solid foundation in HVAC technology through in-depth classroom training sessions.

Candidates wishing to combine the two may do so by attending a college program and completing a short apprenticeship afterward.

**3\. Become Licensed by the State Board**

Pennsylvania is one of the few states that doesn't mandate licensing for HVAC technicians and contractors at a state level. However, certain local municipalities in the state do.
