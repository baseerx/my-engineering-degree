The following are the critical steps to becoming an HVAC technician in New York.

* **College/Trade Programs** - Colleges and trade schools in New York offer HVAC programs. They are essential to familiarize yourself with ventilation and air conditioning basics. Graduates often leave with a degree and may need help securing employment.
