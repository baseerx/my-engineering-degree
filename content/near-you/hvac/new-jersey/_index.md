## **How to Become an HVAC Technician in New Jersey**

Numerous pathways exist to becoming an HVAC technician in New Jersey. They include academic programs, apprenticeship programs, and on-the-job training instructions.

We take a look at all of the possible combinations below.

**Graduating from a 4-Year HVAC Academic Program**

According to the state's laws, an HVAC technician in New Jersey may begin their career by graduating from a four-year academic program at a college or trade university. They must graduate with a bachelor's degree and then acquire one year of experience learning under a licensed master HVAC contractor.

**Graduating from a 4-Year non-HVAC Academic Program**

The state also specifies that candidates who graduate from a non-HVAC field may qualify to practice as professional HVAC technicians if it is a related field. After completing their four-year education in that field, they must back it up with three years of experience learning under a licensed master HVAC contractor in the state.

**Graduating from a 2-Year HVAC Academic Program**

Candidates who graduate from two-year degree programs from community colleges and trade schools may also become professional HVAC technicians in New Jersey. To qualify for approval from the state, they must consolidate their two-year degree with an additional two years of learning in an apprenticeship program.

In addition to the time spent in the above programs, they must also complete a year of real-world experience learning under a master HVAC contractor in the state.

**Graduating from an Apprenticeship Program**

Another option to begin an HVAC technician career in New Jersey is to complete a four-year apprenticeship program. Candidates who use this strategy must ensure that they enroll in an apprenticeship approved by the Department of Labor.

After graduating from the four-year program, candidates must also acquire one year of experience practicing under a master HVAC contractor.
