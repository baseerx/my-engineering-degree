## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

The state of Colorado does not have mandatory licensing requirements for HVAC technicians. It falls upon cities and counties within the state to issue possible licenses, and as such, candidates are always advised to consult their local oversight bodies for updated requirements.

Additionally, HVAC technicians in the state who are involved in any form of electrical or plumbing job must obtain a state-level electrical/plumbing license from the ***Colorado State Plumbing Board*** or the ***Colorado Electrical Board*** — both of which fall under the ***Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies***.

Lastly, professionals in the state handling refrigerants must receive certification from the US ***Environmental Protection Agency*** and ***OSHA***.
