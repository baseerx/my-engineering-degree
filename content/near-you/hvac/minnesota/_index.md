## **How to Become an HVAC Technician in Minnesota**

Below are the steps involved in starting an HVAC technician career in Minnesota.

**Meeting the Basic Requirements**

Meeting the basic requirement of being at least 18 years old and having a high school diploma or GED is necessary for anyone looking to become an HVAC technician in Minnesota. Both of these provisions are critical regarding security admission into an appropriate training program. They are also needed to secure employment.

**Training Program**

When it comes to actual technical training to attain the skills needed to work as an HVAC technician in Minnesota, there are a few options to consider, including the following:

**Degree and Certificate Programs**

Even though HVAC technicians in Minnesota are not expected by law to have advanced degrees from colleges and technical schools, many people choose to do so anyway simply because it offers a higher appeal when securing employment.

It can also lead to a higher salary and a solid understanding of basic principles. Those who wish to graduate faster may opt for certificate programs, while those who don't mind the time may opt for associate degree or even bachelor’s degree programs.

**Apprenticeships**

As mentioned earlier, HVAC technicians in Minnesota can start their careers without advanced education. Many candidates simply enroll in an apprenticeship program and obtain critical skills this way.

Apprenticeship training programs are typically organized by unions and approved parties. They focus on hands-on training and power tools, which take 3 to 4 years to complete.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

The *Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry* needs to set specific licensing requirements for HVAC technicians in the state. However, counties and cities have the right to oversee these requirements.

For instance, the Minneapolis and Saint Paul metropolitan areas mandate HVAC technicians to be certified before securing employment. This certification is offered by the ***Minneapolis Construction Code Services*** or the ***Saint Paul Department of Safety and Inspection*** – depending on the jurisdiction an HVAC technician falls under.

However, candidates will also be glad to know that both areas have a reciprocity agreement, meaning that certification obtained in Minneapolis is also valid in Saint Paul and vice versa.
