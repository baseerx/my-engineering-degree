## **How to Become an HVAC Technician in Michigan**

Apart from meeting the essential requirement of being at least 18 years old and having a high school diploma or GED, the most crucial step in becoming an HVAC technician in Michigan is to acquire appropriate training.

In this regard, there are a few options, including the following:

**Degree and Certificate Programs**

Even though HVAC technicians in Michigan are not mandated by law to have advanced degrees from colleges and technical schools, many choose this route simply because it offers more appeal when securing employment.

It also sometimes leads to a higher starting salary and a solid theoretical knowledge of basic principles.

Those who wish to graduate faster and kick-start their career as soon as possible may choose the certificate option. In contrast, those who don't mind spending more time in school may go for associate degree or even bachelorâ€™s degree programs.

**Apprenticeships**

Because, as mentioned earlier, HVAC technicians in Michigan don't need advanced education to start their careers, many people simply enroll in an apprenticeship program and obtain all the training they need this way.

From the start, apprenticeship training programs are often organized by unions and approved companies looking to build up new technicians in their ethos.

Students are also trained to operate hand and power tools, make necessary repairs, and become familiar with essential materials.

Most apprenticeship programs last between 3 to 4 years.
