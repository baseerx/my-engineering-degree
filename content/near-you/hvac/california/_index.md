## **Steps to Become an HVAC Technician in California**

The following are the most common steps involved in becoming an HVAC technician in California:

**1\. Complete High School**

Before becoming an HVAC technician in California, you must complete high school and receive a diploma. Those who didn't attend high school may also use a GED equivalent. Either of these credentials will be required when it's time to enroll in a training program and when it's time to become certified as well.

**2\. Receive Proper Training**

Regarding training to become an HVAC technician, there are two alternatives to consider. The first is to acquire training on the job, while the second is to attend a formal training program from a college or trade school.

**3\. On-the-Job Training**

HVAC technicians with a high school diploma or GED may choose to begin their career directly by applying for an apprenticeship spot at an approved training center. Unions and companies often run these programs.

Training on the job is an attractive option as it allows candidates to learn from experienced HVAC technicians and enjoy their mentorship at the same time.

* **HVAC Training Program**\- Candidates wishing to acquire formal training before seeking employment may consider a college training program instead of an apprenticeship. They get to earn an associate degree and gain knowledge of critical theories that often comes in handy when it's time to sit for certification/licensing exams.
* **Licensing and Certification**\- In California, HVAC technicians must be licensed by the Contractors State License Board to take on contracts worth more than $500. This includes the price of labor and materials periods.

The state board holds a monthly free workshop explaining how to become a licensed HVAC technician in California.
