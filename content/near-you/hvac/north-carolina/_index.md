**Apprenticeships**

Again, like most skilled trades, it is possible to begin a career as an HVAC technician by enrolling in an apprenticeship program organized by union and non-union organizations all around the state.

Apprenticeship programs also provide a solid foundation for future technicians to build on, with more emphasis on hands-on training in a real-world setting.

Candidates also get to be mentored by seasoned professionals in the field.
