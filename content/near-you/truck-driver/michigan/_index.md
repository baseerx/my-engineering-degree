If there's one thing all truck drivers are familiar with, it is road maps. It makes sense then that you must become familiar with the truck driving career roadmap as an aspiring Michigan truck driver before you even start.

Thankfully, this particular roadmap is relatively straightforward. It includes understanding the job's basic requirements, the general needs of aspiring truck drivers all over the country, and specific requirements concerning truck drivers in Michigan alone.

Thankfully, that is precisely what the article below provides.

Here, we discuss the above requirements and possible licensure/certification, top programs, and potential salary at various points of your career.

## **How to Become a Truck Driver in Michigan**

The following are the steps involved in becoming a truck driver in the state of Michigan:

**Understanding Vehicular Classifications**

An aspiring truck driver in Michigan must understand the following vehicular licensure classifications:

* **Class A** - Class A license includes vehicles with gross combination weights of more than 26,000 pounds and towing vehicles with gross vehicle weights of more than 10,000 pounds.
* **Class B** - Class B licenses include vehicles with a gross vehicle weight of more than 26,000 pounds and towing vehicles that are less than 10,000 pounds in gross vehicle weight.
* **Class C** - Class C licenses include vehicles transporting more than 16 people or carrying hazardous materials.

**Enrolling in a Training Program**

Not all aspiring truck drivers in Michigan enroll in truck driving schools, but most do, simply because doing so offers several benefits. For instance, training programs prepare students for the commercial driver's license test, ensuring they have all the tools required to pass on the first try.

Additionally, some training programs, mainly those run by trucking companies, offer an easier route to securing employment, as candidates may opt to work for the company once they graduate and obtain their CDL.

**CDL Basic Requirements**

Aspiring truck drivers in Michigan must meet the state's CDL requirements before applying for the CDL test. Currently, these requirements include:

* Being at least 18 years old for intrastate driving and 21 years old for interstate driving,
* Being physically fit and in good health,
* Having a non-CDL license,
* Being a US citizen or having a legal presence in the country, and
* Having no driving conviction in the last 24 months.

**CDL Testing**

Lastly, applicants must apply and complete the CDL test to obtain their CDL, including knowledge and road skills tests. These tests examine a candidate's understanding of laws and regulations, pre-trip inspection, and vehicle maneuverability.

## **State Licensure and Certification Requirements**

Applicants must pay the appropriate licensing fees to take the CDL test and officially become truck drivers in Michigan. This includes a $25 fee for obtaining a standard CDL or a $45 fee for an enhanced CDL. Additional endorsements also require a $5 payment for each approval.

Examples of endorsement codes in the state include T for double or triple trailers, P for passenger vehicles, N for tank vehicles, H for hazardous materials, and S for school buses.

It is also worth mentioning that the state reserves the right to disqualify a driver's CDL if they meet any of the disqualification criteria, which include driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances and fleeing from the accident scene, among others.
