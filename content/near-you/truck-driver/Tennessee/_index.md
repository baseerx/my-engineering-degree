The path toward becoming a heavy truck driver is relatively straightforward. Many struggle with the process not because of many impossible obstacles to overcome but because they have no idea what to expect beforehand.

To help you avoid this, we have provided a comprehensive guide below detailing everything you need to know to become a heavy truck driver in Tennessee. You'll find helpful information such as the certification and licensing requirements, educational requirements, and the potential salary range to look forward to every year.

## **How to Become a Heavy Truck Driver in Tennessee**

To become a heavy truck driver in Tennessee, you must obtain a commercial driver's license (CDL). The following are the steps involved in the process:

**Step 1: Get Familiar with CDL Categories**

The following are the CDL classes in Tennessee:

**Class A**

A class A CDL allows truck drivers to drive a combination of vehicles totaling more than 26,000 in gross weight, pulling a car with a gross weight of about 10,000 pounds.

A Class A license is the perfect option for heavy truck drivers.

**Class B**

Class B CDL allows truck drivers to operate single vehicles with a gross vehicle weight of 26,000 pounds towing a trailer less than 10,001 pounds in GVW.

**Class C**

A class CDL allows truck drivers to operate a single vehicle with a gross vehicle weight under 26,001 pounds, tow a trailer less than 10,001 pounds, carry more than 16 passengers, or transport hazardous materials.

**Step 2: Know the Basic Requirements**

An aspiring heavy truck driver in Tennessee must be at least 21 years old to work in interstate commerce. Those wishing to drive a school bus must be at least 25.

Candidates must also provide proof of social security, DOT medical card, Tennessee driver's license, and proof of residency.

As for the physical requirements, candidates must have vision in both eyes, be able to differentiate colors, hear at a distance of at least 5 feet, have a blood sugar no higher than 200, and be free of Schedule 1 drugs, narcotics, and amphetamine.

**Step 3: Know the Disqualification Criteria**

Other conditions that may lead to disqualification for aspiring truck drivers in Tennessee include having a criminal history of committing serious offenses such as kidnapping, drunk driving, extortion, and arson and having certain specified medical conditions such as diabetes, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure.

Some of these conditions can be waived with a letter from a physician.

Those who already have their CDLs may end up being disqualified if they develop high blood sugar, refuse a blood test, commit a felony, or leave the scene of an accident.

**Step 4: Enroll in a Training School**

CDL training schools prepare students for their CDL exams. Several training programs in Tennessee teach students how to get their CDL.

Usually, these programs take 3 to 7 weeks to complete, but the exact duration will ultimately depend on your choice of institution.

Companies, community colleges, and private training academies offer CDL training.

**Step 5: CDL Fees in Tennessee**

Aspiring truck drivers must apply for and pass a learner's permit exam before applying for the actual CDL.

A commercial driver's license in Tennessee will remain valid for five years, while a commercial learner's permit lasts a year. Their costs tend to vary according to specific categories.

**Learner's Permit Fees**

* Commercial Learner's Permit Class A costs $14.
* Commercial Learner's Permit Class B/C costs $13.

**Commercial Driver's License Fees**

* CDL Class A costs $70
* CDL Class B/C costs $62
* 1st CDL Replacement costs $12
* Subsequent CDL Replace costs $16

**Step 6: CLP & CDL Testing**

CDL testing in Tennessee includes knowledge and skills tests. The knowledge test is needed to obtain a commercial learner's permit, and the skills tests â€“ which include an inspection test, basic vehicle control check, and a road test - are needed to obtain the actual CDL.
