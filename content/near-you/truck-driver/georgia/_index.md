Truck drivers have incredible maneuverability skills, but they also have a high level of endurance, physical stamina, control, critical thinking skills, and many more traits that are important for the job.

While some people are naturally blessed with all of these, even the most gifted truck drivers still need to be trained to improve themselves, understand the pertinent laws and regulations, and be the best truck drivers can be.

To that end, we have provided the guide below to help aspiring truck drivers in Georgia become familiar with the requirements for starting a truck driving career there.

We have also highlighted the possible licensing and certification requirements and the potential salary to expect, among other things.

## **How to Become a Truck Driver in Georgia**

The steps to become a truck driver in Georgia include:

**1\. Basic Requirements**

An aspiring truck driver in Georgia must meet some basic requirements, including a specification that they must be at least 18 years old to drive within the state or 21 years old to drive outside Georgia.

Candidates must also be prepared to show pertinent paperwork such as their medical certification, non-CDL Georgia driver's license, and proof of payment for associated fees.

**2\. Training Program**

While training programs are not mandated for truck drivers in Georgia, many choose to attend one anyway simply because these programs help make passing the CDL test easier. Additionally, they also teach a lot of critical skills that will prove invaluable along the course of a truck driving career.

**3\. CLP - Conditional Learner's Permit**

The journey to obtaining a commercial driver's license in Georgia usually begins with getting a commercial learner's permit or a "conditional learner's permit." This will allow candidates to practice their driving skills on Georgia Road.

To obtain a conditional learner's permit, applicants must schedule an appointment with the Georgia Department of Driver Services, submit their driving record, and pass a handful of written exams.

**4\. CDL Skills & Knowledge Test**

After obtaining a learner's permit and feeling satisfied with your training, the next step is to apply for the actual CDL. Candidates who have successfully submitted their application may then undergo and pass a driving skills test.

During the skills test, drivers will prove that they can carry out appropriate pre-trip inspections, successfully maneuver a heavy truck, and showcase competency on the road in the presence of a supervisor.

## **State Licensure and Certification Requirements**

Following the above steps should fulfill the licensure requirements needed to become a truck driver in Georgia. Of course, the state also requires a CDL holder's medical certificate to show they are physically and mentally qualified for the profession.

Candidates must also be prepared to pay a number of fees, including $35 for the commercial learner's permit and $10 for the permit fee.

To take the road skills test, applicants must pay a $50 fee before paying the $32 fee for the actual license.

Those who wish to acquire further endorsements (for example, the hazardous material endorsement to transport of dangerous materials) must pay an additional $5 after the issuance of each approval.
