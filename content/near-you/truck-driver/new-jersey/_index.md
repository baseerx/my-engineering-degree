## **How to Become a Truck Driver in New Jersey**

Aspiring truck drivers in New Jersey must follow the process below to begin their careers on a strong foundation.

**Meeting the Basic Requirements**

Candidates who wish to obtain a CDL in New Jersey must meet the requirements set by the state. Even though there are many of these, the most basic requirements include being at least 18 years old to drive within the state and being at least 21 years old to handle hazardous materials and drive across borders.

Candidates must also be in sound physical shape and have 20/40 vision in both eyes with and without glasses.

**Meeting the Training Requirements**

All aspiring truck drivers in New Jersey must pass a commercial driver's license test. Enrolling in a training program is usually advisable to pass the test.

These programs teach students classroom principles and real-world driving maneuvers, which will be important when taking the test.

In one of the upcoming sections, we highlight some of the most notable truck driving training programs for aspiring truck drivers in New Jersey.

**Passing your CDL Test**

To acquire their commercial driver's license (CDL), candidates must pass knowledge and skills tests. The knowledge test is written, while the skills test must be demonstrated on the road.

Each knowledge test will have questions dealing with several areas of truck driving, including vehicle operation and safety regulations. Candidates must pass with an 80% score to qualify for their CDL.

The second part of the skills test requires applicants to successfully demonstrate their capability when it safely comes to operating vehicles. This includes pre-trip inspection, basic vehicle control, and on-road driving tests.

**Applying for CDL**

After all of the above, the next step is to apply for your CDL by visiting the DMV office and providing the necessary documentation. The section below explores the key requirements you need to do so successfully.
