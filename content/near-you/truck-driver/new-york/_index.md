Regardless of how far they travel, these professionals play a crucial role in the functioning of any city/state, and New York is no different.

If you want to become a truck driver in New York, one of the most important things you can do is get familiar with the entire process before you even begin.

**Step 2: Obtain a Commercial Learner's Permit**

To obtain a commercial learner's permit, candidates must visit a DMV office candidate and pay a $10 fee. This qualifies them to take all written tests and a road test after getting their learner's permit.

The commercial learner's permit in New York is valid for one year.

**Step 3: Prepare for your CDL Test**
