A career as a truck driver offers the opportunity to contribute to economic growth, earn significant yearly income, visit various parts of the city, and even travel constantly between cities. For those who love adventure and visiting new places, a career as a truck driver in Texas could be a veritable opportunity to consider.

Of course, before embarking on any career path, it's essential to understand the steps involved. Luckily, that is precisely what we provide in the upcoming sections below.

Here, you'll find the key requirements needed to become a truck driver in Texas, possible licensing and certification options, top programs, and the projected average salary for professionals in the field.

## **How to Become a Truck Driver in Texas**

The following are the steps involved in becoming a truck driver in Texas:

**Step 1: Knowing the Vehicle Classification**

One of the first steps in any journey to become a truck driver in Texas is to know the state's various vehicular classifications for truck driver licenses.

Generally, truck drivers find themselves in one of three classes:

* **Class A Licenses** - for vehicles with gross combination weight of up to 26001 pounds, towing vehicles with gross vehicle weight of more than 10,000 pounds.
* **Class B Licenses** - for vehicles with gross vehicle weight of up to 26001 pounds and towing vehicles with less than 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight.
* **Class C Licenses**\- for vehicles designed to transport more than 16 people or vehicles designed to transport hazardous content.

**Step 2: Basic Requirements**

As for the general basic requirements, they include the following:

* Being at least 18 years old to drive within the state,
* Being at least 21 years old to drive across state lines,
* Possessing a valid driver's license,
* Providing identification documents and
* Having a vision in both eyes.

**Step 3: Training & CLP**

Another requirement for becoming a truck driver in Texas is to possess a commercial learner's permit (CLP) 14 days before taking the commercial driver's license test and complete entry-level driver's training from a program approved by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).

Below, we provide a detailed list containing some of these training programs to consider.

**Step 4: CDL Test**

Texas's commercial driver's license (CDL) test requires adequate preparation. The test is divided into a written aspect and a practical aspect.

The written aspect is divided into general knowledge, air brakes, and combination vehicle tests.

Graduating from a prominent training program should prepare you for all the above.

## **State Licensure and Certification Requirements**

Ultimately, once you secure your CDL following the steps above, you can officially begin to work as a truck driver in Texas. The Texas Workforce Commission carries out regulations.

As one would expect, obtaining a CDL in Texas also comes with some fees, including a standard CDL fee of $61 for both new issuances and renewals. Replacement of a lost CDL costs $11.

A Texas CDL is valid for 5 years before it has to be renewed again.

## **Salary and Job Outlook**

In Texas, truck drivers earn an [annual average salary of $98,476](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/transportation-and-material-moving/heavy-and-tractor-trailer-truck-drivers.htm). This figure is around 7% higher than the national average and is to be expected for those who have reached a midpoint in their career.

Truck drivers starting in the state may understandably earn less, most likely taking home an annual average salary of around $53,308. With more time and experience, however, a Texan truck driver can make as high as $181,918 every year.

The highest-paying cities in the state are Midland, Irving, and Odessa, with annual average salaries of $112,456, $110,939, and $104,997, respectively. Austin and Pasadena round up the top five with average yearly salaries of $104,220 and $101,583, respectively.
