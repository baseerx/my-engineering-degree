A truck driver must be good at truck driving. After all, that is the job they are paid for. However, most people must learn that truck drivers must also be good at several other things, including critical thinking, endurance, physical stamina, problem-solving, safety consciousness, and more.

To learn all of these skills, individuals aspiring to become truck drivers must go through a handful of steps that are similar between states but with a few significant variations.

Luckily, for aspiring truck drivers in Illinois, we have provided below a comprehensive guide containing all these critical steps and other important information, such as possible salary and job outlook.

## **How to Become a Truck Driver in Illinois**

The first step in becoming a truck driver in Illinois is to become familiar with the general requirements. To become a truck driver, applicants must be at least 18 years old to drive within the state and 21 years old to drive outside.

They must also have a valid non-CDL driver's license and be able to prove that they are residents of the United States.

CDL applicants in Illinois with CDLs from other States must go through the same steps as first-time applicants.

**Enrolling in a Training Program**

After meeting the above requirements, the next logical step for aspiring truck drivers in Illinois is to start training to acquire the necessary skills to become competent truck drivers.

Most truck-driving programs are organized by private academies (who sometimes offer direct pipelines to become employed by the company) or by community colleges and other training institutions.

Training programs tend to do their best to prepare their students for the CDL and ensure they meet the requirements.

**CLP Test**

Before obtaining a commercial driver's license CDL in Illinois, drivers must obtain a commercial learner's permit (CLP). Getting a CLP involves passing a set of written examinations. Training programs may help prepare students for their CLP tests as well.

The CDL test in Illinois includes a set of knowledge and skill tests. The basic knowledge test will cover 20 general areas and contain at least 30 test items. To pass the test, candidates must attain an 80% score.

The skill tests involve performing a handful of required skills in a vehicle representing the type of vehicle the candidate will operate.
