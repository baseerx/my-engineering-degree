If you are an aspiring masonry worker in the state and need help figuring out how to start your career, you have come to the right page. The following sections deal with all the key considerations that future masonry worker in Massachusetts must know before starting their careers.

A clear picture of all these steps will ensure that candidates make the right decisions and enjoy the process. We have also included details about other important topics, including top programs to consider and possible salary projections.

## **How to Become a Masonry Worker in Massachusetts**

The following are the most important considerations for beginning a masonry worker in Massachusetts.

**Meet the Basic Prerequisites**

Although the state does not set prerequisites for masonry workers in Massachusetts, training programs and employers typically require candidates to have a high school diploma or GED before starting their careers.

Some may also ask that candidates be at least 17 years old.

**Receive Masonry Training**

Naturally, the most important step in becoming a mason in Massachusetts is to receive masonry training. This can be done through either of the avenues below:

**Academic Masonry Training**

Academic training for masons offers several benefits. In addition to working on residential projects, they can use their degrees and certificates to secure employment at top establishments across the state.

While these programs may prioritize classroom training, they also arrange for students to receive hands-on training.

Examples of academic masonry training programs are acquired from trade schools and community colleges.

**On-the-Job Training**

Aspiring masons who want to avoid attending academic programs may receive training on the job. This can be done via an apprenticeship program organized by unions, professional organizations, employers, and local governments.

**Become Certified**

A masonry worker in Massachusetts may gain several benefits from becoming certified. At the top of the list, though, is the fact that certification makes employment easier.

The section below explores some popular avenues to consider for masonry workers looking to become certified, including a state-specific option.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

Masonry workers in Massachusetts are expected to become certified. In most states, masons pursue certification from third-party professional organizations like the National Center for Construction Education and Research.

However, Massachusetts has specific professional certifications, namely the Bricklayer and Stonemason certificates.

Candidates may earn this certification and then pursue the certification offered by NCCER. This way, they can enjoy all the benefits of certification.

Concerning licensing, masonry workers in Massachusetts are not expected to obtain a license if they only work on residential projects. However, they must pass a licensing exam to work on commercial projects.
