**Acquire Work Experience**

Real-world experience is so vital for a masonry worker that some refuse to attend official academic programs and instead focus on apprenticeship programs.

**Apprenticeship versus Assistant Duties**

Apprenticeship programs and working as an assistant to a practicing masonry worker offer the opportunity to receive training on the job. The difference, however, is that while apprenticeship programs focus on hands-on training, they also involve classroom training.

In assistant arrangements, most of the duties involve shadowing the master masonry worker and taking note of how they go about their responsibilities in the real world.
