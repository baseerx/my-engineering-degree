### Bordentown International Masonry Institute

Located on Route 206, South Bordentown, the program uses IMI (International Masonry Institute) curriculum to bring up future masons and help them acquire the skills they will need to enjoy a successful career on the job.

The program tries as much as possible to incorporate hands-on training while ensuring students are theoretically sound. Classes are overseen by experienced instructors who are practicing masons themselves.

### Bricklayers And Allied Craftworkers Local 4

BAC Local 4 in Fairfield offers an apprenticeship program for future masonry workers. Like all masonry apprenticeship training programs, students who enroll here will enjoy a lot of hands-on training under the tutelage of masons who have achieved much success in the field.
