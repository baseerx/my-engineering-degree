An aspiring masonry worker in Tennessee must first become familiar with the basic educational requirements to secure admission into a training program. From there, they must identify the best training destinations in the state while choosing which training avenue suits their requirements.

They must also understand certification options and the importance of certification and licensure in the first place. Finally, it also helps greatly if they know the salary averages to expect at various career points.

Luckily, we look into all these in great detail below. By the time they finish the article, aspiring masonry workers in Tennessee will have all they need to start their careers on the right path.

## **How to Become a Masonry Worker in Tennessee**

Future masonry workers in Tennessee may consider the steps below to kick-start their careers.

**Step 1: High School Diploma or GED**

Candidates need a high-school diploma or GED to start working as a mason in Tennessee.

It will also be very beneficial if they have experience in mathematics, the English language, and a few technical-related subjects.

The importance of having a high school diploma or GED goes beyond being able to enroll in a training program.

These credentials may also be used to secure employment in a masonry establishment where candidates can learn while they work.

**Step 2: Apprenticeship Training**

Apprenticeship training is the most popular avenue to acquire the skills needed to become a professional masonry worker in Tennessee. Trade unions and employers usually run such programs. Still, it is also possible for government bodies and vocational colleges to have their apprenticeship arrangements for future masons in the state.

During an apprenticeship training program, accepted applicants will learn the technical key topics they need in the classroom while also being able to practice what they are learning in workshop environments. They also get to enjoy mentorship opportunities from established masons.

Most masonry apprenticeship programs last between 2 to 4 years.

**Step 3: Certification**

As a fresh masonry worker in Tennessee, you are not obligated by law to pursue certification. However, it is common for candidates to do so simply because it affords them several opportunities, such as making them more appealing to prospective employers.

The upcoming section will examine Tennessee's certification and licensing requirements for masonry workers.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

The major factor that decides whether a mason in Tennessee will need a license (and which license they will have to obtain) is the total volume of their projects.

Those working on projects worth more than $100,000 (in both the cost of labor and material) will have to obtain a contractor license. To do so, they must sit for the licensed masonry contractor examination.

While the state of Tennessee does not have a mandatory certification requirement, candidates who wish to obtain one anyway may go for the ***Certified Masonry Technician*** credential offered by the IMI (International Masonry Institute) or the ***Certified Bricklayer*** credential offered by the NCMA (National Concrete Masonry Association).
