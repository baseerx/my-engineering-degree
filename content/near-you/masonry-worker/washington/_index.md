## **How to Become a Masonry Worker in Washington**

Below are the steps to starting a career as a masonry worker in Washington.

**Basic Preparation**

Aspiring masonry workers in Washington are advised to prepare for training by having their high school diploma or GED ready. Having a foundation in high school mathematics, English, and technical-related subjects will also allow them to start their careers much faster.

Preparation is also not limited to educational topics alone. Candidates can prepare for masonry requirements by getting into a solid physical shape. This will help a lot since the field involves a lot of heavy lifting, standing, and kneeling.

**Core Skills Preparation**

Candidates should also prepare to acquire skills to help them stand out. For example, apart from the actual technical skills, future masons in Washington may train themselves to be attentive to detail and embrace challenging scenarios requiring great problem-solving.

**Apprenticeship Training**

Aspiring masonry workers often go with apprenticeship training for their actual masonry retraining. Through this arrangement, they will learn everything they need to know to start their careers, including technical, interpersonal, and problem-solving skills.

Most apprenticeship programs, including classroom instructions and hands-on training, can be completed in 2 to 4 years. Masonry apprenticeship programs can be organized by community colleges, vocational schools, and trade unions in the area.

**Continual Improvements**

Lastly, even after acquiring the expertise needed to practice professionally, a masonry worker must keep improving by participating in workshops, seminars, and other continuing education avenues. They may also consider some of the certification options we dive into below.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

According to the [Washington State Department of Labor and Industries](https://www.lni.wa.gov/), masonry contractors in the state must be registered before they can start taking up contracts. The state classifies two different categories of contractors, which include the general contractors and the specialty contractors.

For the registration, candidates must fulfill certain requirements involving choosing a business structure and a business name, purchasing surety bonds and insurance, and paying a registration fee.

A contractor license only applies to those who will not be working under masonry contractors in the state. Certification is optional, but candidates may apply for the Certified Bricklayer credential from the [National Concrete Masonry Association](https://ncma.org/) to further their careers.
