Typically, masons in Seattle, Washington, must spend around 2 to 4 years obtaining training before launching a career. Although several steps are involved in starting a masonry career, the most important is acquiring the right training at the right program.

With this, it will be easier for a mason to keep up when they secure employment, and it would be almost impossible to scale and take advantage of career growth opportunities.

To that end, we have provided a comprehensive list of the best and most notable training programs for masonry workers in and around Seattle, Washington. We have also included a broad overview of what makes these programs special and why they deserve your attention.

## **How to Become a Masonry Worker in Seattle**

Anyone looking to become a masonry worker in Seattle must ensure that they have a high school diploma or GED. This will qualify them to seek a position as a masonry worker's assistant in training or enroll in an apprenticeship program.

Candidates who enroll in an apprenticeship program will learn what they need to know to be considered a professional mason via an extremely hands-on environment. They will also gain real-world experience and mentorship from established masons.
