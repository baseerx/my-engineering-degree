Masons in Pennsylvania can specialize in several fields, including brick, cement, stone, and terrazzo masonry. Moreover, they can specialize even further under any of these categories by, for instance, working with specific structures and materials, including granite, marble, paving stones, and more.

Regardless of their specialization, however, training is one aspect of becoming a masonry worker in Pennsylvania that must be considered, along with basic requirements.

To that end, we have provided below a detailed look at the broad steps involved in becoming a mason in Pennsylvania, a list containing some of the best training programs in the state, and the potential salary to expect on the job.

## **How to Become a Masonry Worker in Pennsylvania**

To become a masonry worker in Pennsylvania, aspiring candidates must follow the framework highlighted below:

**Provide a High School Diploma or GED**

A prospective masonry worker in Pennsylvania needs a high school diploma or a GED equivalent to begin their careers. This usually comes in handy when securing admission into training programs.

Apprenticeship programs also often ask for either of these credentials.

**Choose a Training Option**

It is common to consider one of three approaches to obtain training as a prospective masonry worker in Pennsylvania. These include enrolling in an academic training program, an apprenticeship program, or working as a masonry assistant.

* **Enrolling in a Formal Training Program** â€“ Becoming a mason in Pennsylvania is possible by attending a formal college or trade school program. The diploma or degree obtained from a formal training program often goes a long way in helping graduates secure employment.
* **Enrolling in an Apprenticeship Program** - Apprentice programs are responsible for producing competent masonry workers. They use a framework that ensures students obtain a solid foundation in classroom topics and actual hands-on training in the real world.
* **Working as a Masonry Assistant** - Another way to become a masonry worker in Pennsylvania is to work as an assistant to an experienced mason. Doing this for a couple of years usually results in having the needed real-world experience and technical solidity to enjoy a successful career in the field.

Of course, it is also possible to combine two or more of the above approaches by, for instance, working as a masonry assistant for a few months after graduating from a formal training program or combining formal training with a brief stint as an apprentice.
