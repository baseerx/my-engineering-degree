Masonry workers are trained professionals with extensive knowledge of fabricating functional components from natural/man-made materials such as stones, cement, concrete, marble, and more. In North Carolina, individuals pursuing a career as masonry workers enjoy a high demand for their expertise regardless of their areas of specialization.

Before an aspiring masonry worker in the state can begin their career, however, they must note a few essential things. These include the basic educational requirements, training options, certification, and more.

## **How to Become a Masonry Worker in North Carolina**

Below are the steps involved in becoming a masonry worker in North Carolina:

**Basic Requirements**

Like most states, North Carolina does not set a minimum educational requirement for masonry workers in the area. Instead, it is up to training institutions and employers to set their needs.

As it happens, most tend to follow the same pattern: to ask for a high school diploma or GED and a driver's license.

Some also ask for construction experience and medical certificates, although rare.

**Training Options**

All aspiring masonry workers must obtain one form of training or another before they can secure employment. In this regard, there are two alternatives:

**Academic Program**

Academic programs for aspiring masonry workers in North Carolina focus on classroom instructions while providing hands-on experience in the workshop. Depending on the training program, applicants may also expect financial aid and job placement assistance by the time they are done.

It is also possible that a masonry establishment will be more willing to employ masonry workers with a degree over those without.

**On-the-Job Training**

Apprenticeship programs provide training on the job for aspiring masonry workers in North Carolina. Like some college programs, apprenticeship programs also try to balance classroom training and hands-on instruction.

Additionally, colleges and vocational schools can partner with apprenticeship programs to allow students to enjoy a more robust masonry education.
