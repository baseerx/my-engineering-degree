A career as a masonry worker in Illinois can be fulfilling for several reasons. For one, masons in the state earn an annual salary that can rival most places in the country while having a constant stream of demand that keeps them occupied virtually throughout the year.

To start your journey as a prospective masonry worker in Illinois, it is important to familiarize yourself with all of the essential steps involved in the process before you begin.

Thankfully, that is precisely what the article below provides.

Here, you'll find details about how to become a masonry worker in Illinois, the licensure and certification requirements, and the potential salary, among others.

## **How to Become a Masonry Worker in Illinois**

Below are the steps involved in starting a masonry career in Illinois:

**Basic Educational Requirements**

The primary educational requirements for becoming a mason in Illinois usually depend on the training program into which an applicant enrolls. Currently, most training programs require a high school diploma or a GED before admission can be granted. Some also set a minimum age requirement of 17 years old.

**Training Programs**

Because there are no postsecondary academic requirements for masonry workers in Illinois, masons in the state can only secure employment after graduating from a college or technical school program.

Of course, this is not to say that there aren't impressive colleges and vocational schools in the state offering masonry programs in one form or another. Still, it simply means that masons who do not wish to attend formal academic programs can acquire on-the-job training.

**Training On the Job**

Masons who have chosen to acquire training on the job may do so in one of two ways. The first approach is to apply to apprenticeship programs. Nowadays, some apprenticeship programs like to incorporate some classroom training, which may make them quite similar to academic programs. The difference, however, is that an apprenticeship program usually includes more hands-on training and real-world experience.

Another approach is to work as a masonry worker's assistant. In such an arrangement, the master mason provides mentorship and technical training for the student for a few years until they're ready to take on contracts on their own.

Masonry workers in Illinois are expected to acquire a masonry contractor license from their respective cities or municipalities. Requirements tend to vary between different locations.

In Chicago, masons are expected to acquire a [City of Chicago masonry contractor license](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/bldgs/supp_info/TLdetails/masoncontractor.html) to work in stone, concrete, and brick masonry, among others.

Those exempted from this license include masons carrying out limited or ground-level sidewalks and paving projects, masons overseeing works at properties that are their primary residence, masons performing repairs on structures that do not require a building permit, and masons working at properties controlled by government entities.
