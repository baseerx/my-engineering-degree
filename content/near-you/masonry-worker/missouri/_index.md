## **How to Become a Masonry Worker in Missouri**

Below is a step-by-step breakdown of Missouri's requirements for becoming a masonry worker.

**Step 1A: Obtain Masonry Training from an Academic Program**

The most important part of becoming a mason in Missouri is obtaining masonry training. This can be done through either of two methods: the first is to attend an academic program, while the second is to attend a program that allows for training on the job.

Enroll in an academic program for a couple of months, earn a certificate, and then proceed to the second part of the first step.

**Step 1B: Acquire On-the-Job Training**

Those who do not wish to attend academic programs — or those who wish to acquire additional hands-on training — may receive training on the job. This can be done by attending an apprenticeship program or securing entry-level positions with employers who accept candidates looking to learn on the job.

While apprenticeship programs are not official jobs, they may let students earn while learning. Additionally, some on-the-job entry-level positions may pay some salary to compensate workers for their efforts.

**Step 2: Consider Certification**

After acquiring relevant training, a masonry worker in Missouri can begin their careers immediately. However, many choose to obtain professional credentials for even better employment opportunities.

We will be exploring possible certification options in the next section.

**Step 3: Secure Employment**

Lastly, candidates may assemble a resume after training and certification and apply for relevant masonry positions in various specialty areas.
