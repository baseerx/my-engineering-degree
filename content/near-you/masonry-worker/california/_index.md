In California and anywhere else in the country, masonry workers leverage the power of bricks and concrete blocks to create beautiful structures such as walls, fences, and walkways. They also work with natural and artificial stones to achieve the same objectives.

Becoming a masonry worker requires a lot of training. But in California, it also requires getting familiar with a few necessary steps, including prerequisites, educational requirements, licensing requirements, and more.

If you're an aspiring masonry worker in California, we have provided detailed guides on these issues below.

## **How to Become a Masonry Worker in California**

The following are the steps required to begin a career as a masonry worker in California:

**Have a High School Diploma or GED**

Aspiring masonry workers in California are expected to fulfill a few basic requirements before starting their training. Sometimes, this includes being at least 17 years old, but most times, candidates are expected to have a high school diploma or a GED equivalent in its place.

**Obtain Formal Training**

The most important aspect of becoming a masonry worker is learning how to do the job. Usually, this training can be obtained on the job, at a formal training institution, or both.

Combining both forms of training is regarded as the best alternative because each has its perks.

Formal training, for instance, is notable for focusing on fundamental topics such as wall construction, blueprint reading, trade Mathematics, and mortar mixing, among others.

Candidates also leave with a degree and a strong resume.

**Obtain Training On-the-Job**

Just like formal training, obtaining training on the job for a prospective masonry worker also has its benefits. Apprenticeship training programs, for instance, offer a structured environment that concentrates on hands-on training while leaving room for classroom training.

Additionally, prospective masonry workers can also obtain training on the job by working as assistants for experienced masons for 1 to 2 years. This way, they learn in the real world, acquire expertise, and enjoy solid mentorships simultaneously.

**Create your Resume**

After their training, aspiring masonry workers in California can create resumes by listing their education and work experience. They may also include references and photos from previous jobs.
