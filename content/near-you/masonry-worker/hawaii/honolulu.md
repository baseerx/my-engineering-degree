## **How to Become a Masonry Worker in Honolulu**

To become a masonry worker in Honolulu, you must at least possess a high school diploma or a GED. These are enough to get you into a vocational or an apprenticeship program.

Those who have prior experience in construction may obtain training on the job.

Masonry workers in Honolulu may also have to specialize in one specialty area: stone masonry, brick masonry, terrazzo, and cement masonry.

Lastly, a mason in Honolulu must also take a licensing examination to become licensed to work with bricks and other baked products in the state.
