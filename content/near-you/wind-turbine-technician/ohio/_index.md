Wind turbine mechanics in Ohio do most of their work on the nacelle part of the wind turbines. This is the component where the drivetrain and sensitive electronics are placed.

They are also able to work on other parts, carrying out troubleshooting and repair when necessary. To begin a career as a wind turbine mechanic in Ohio, individuals must meet specific educational, training, and certification requirements.

Below, we provide clear and concise details regarding each step so interested candidates can easily get their careers started correctly.

We have also included sections detailing some of the top programs in the state to consider, along with the potential salary and career outlook.

## **How to Become a Wind Turbine Mechanic in Ohio**

Below are the steps needed to become a wind turbine mechanic in the state of Ohio:

**Preparatory Stages**

To prepare for a career as a wind turbine mechanic in Ohio, having some experience in high school-level mathematics, physics, and chemistry is usually handy. Once candidates graduate high school, they will need their diploma to secure admission into a training program. Those who don't have a high school diploma may make use of a GED equivalent in this place.

**Complete a Wind turbine Technology Training Program**

For their actual wind turbine mechanic training, candidates may consider the following training routes:

**Training on the Job**

Candidates who wish to acquire a great deal of hands-on experience right from the start may choose to acquire their training “on the job.” However, this approach can be tricky, as training on the job without prior experience may lead to complications.

Also, it is sometimes easier to find opportunities for training on the job with some theoretical experience in the field at first.

**Attending a Training Program**

Candidates may obtain their wind turbine technology training from an academic program usually offered by community colleges and trade schools in the area. A wind turbine technology training program structured this way will emphasize fundamental principles and classroom instructions.

**Combining Both Approaches**

Both academic training and training on the job offer several advantages. This is why the most common route to becoming a wind turbine mechanic is first to attend an academic program and then consolidate this training with further real-world experience on the job.
