## **How to Become a Wind Turbine Mechanic in Virginia**

Below is a step-by-step outline of how to start a wind turbine mechanic career in Virginia.

**Basic Educational Requirements**

It is rare to see a wind turbine mechanic in Virginia start their careers without a high school diploma or at least a GED equivalent. This is because training programs, apprenticeships, and employees all request it before admission can be given.

**Formal Training**

Candidates who successfully secure admission into a wind turbine mechanic training program will receive all the foundational knowledge they need to start their careers. Naturally, as with most academic programs, they will focus more on classroom instructions with a little hands-on training.

**Training on the Job**

After spending 2 years acquiring foundational education in an academic program, wind turbine mechanics in Virginia are still expected to acquire an additional year of training "on the job."

Some employers may even be willing to provide such training for candidates who still need an academic degree. The most popular route, however, is to complete academic training and then receive additional training on the job.

**Certification**

By becoming certified, aspiring wind turbine mechanics in Virginia give themselves a better opportunity to secure high-quality employment in the best organizations. They will also have a platform through which they can network with other professionals in the field and improve themselves significantly.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

Like virtually every other state in the country, the state of Virginia does not have an agency responsible for issuing licenses to wind turbine mechanics. For this reason, professionals in the state are not mandated to receive any license or certification.

Other options include the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP), the [Electronics Technicians Association](http://www.etai.org/) (ETA), and the ENSA North America, Inc. (ENSA).
