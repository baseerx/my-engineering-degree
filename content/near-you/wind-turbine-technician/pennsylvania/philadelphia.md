Wind turbine service mechanics often need to acquire a postsecondary non-degree award at the very least to enter the occupation. They also have to consolidate whatever the classroom education they have received with hands-on experience and on-the-job training.

Below, we provide a quick refresher on starting a career as a wind turbine mechanic in Philadelphia. From there, we highlight some of the most prominent wind turbine mechanic schools for candidates in the area to consider.

The entries on the list have been vetted to ensure a high standard of education, comprehensive curriculum, combination of classroom and hands-on training, state-of-the-art facilities, and other important criteria that separate the top schools from the average ones.

## **How to Become a Wind Turbine Mechanic in Philadelphia**

As a prospective wind turbine mechanic in Philadelphia, the first thing you must do on your journey is have a high school diploma or GED. You may then use these to secure admission into a training program.

The best academic training programs — such as the ones listed below — are great for receiving foundational training and becoming familiar with what to expect on the job. However, students must also receive hands-on training that involves working with wind turbine components. They may do so by participating in an apprenticeship or receiving job training.

Lastly, individuals may consider applying for certification on the road to becoming a wind turbine mechanic in Philadelphia. Even though this step is not compulsory, it offers various benefits. The two most prominent professional organizations to consider are the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) and the Electronics Technicians Association (ETA).
