## **How to Become a Wind Turbine Mechanic in California**

The following are the key steps to starting a wind turbine mechanic career in California.

**Step 1: High School Diploma or GED**

The basic educational requirement for California wind turbine technicians is a high school diploma or GED. Receiving additional formal education after this is optional, but regardless of the chosen training path, employers and instructors will most likely ask for either of these credentials.

**Step 2: Attend a Training Program**

Typically, wind turbine mechanics in California start their careers by attending a technical school. They will learn all the theoretical skills required to secure employment during their program. Most wind turbine mechanic schools are arranged as a 2-year technical program.

Students may also be focused on classroom instructions, with the hands-on experience part of the training left to potential employers.

**Step 3: Hands-On Training**

While academic training programs focus predominantly on classroom instructions and topics, candidates still need real-world experience to succeed as wind turbine technicians.

It is common for this part of the training to be reserved until after employment is secured. Employers will then have the duty of providing on-the-job training for some time until the candidates are satisfied with their learning.

Usually, on-the-job training for wind turbine mechanics in California lasts 12 months.

**Step 4: Certification and Employment**

Lastly, wind turbine mechanics in California are advised to become certified to improve their career opportunities and network with fellow professionals in the field. As we will see below, certification is optional but very important.

From here, candidates may assemble their resumes and apply for jobs at relevant companies.
