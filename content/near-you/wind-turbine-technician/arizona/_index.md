In Arizona, wind turbine mechanics leverage their extensive knowledge of wind turbine technology to help repair, maintain, and install critical components that make the technology function as it should. Thanks in part to the gradual global shift towards renewable energy, the field is fast becoming one of the most popular options for individuals in the state.

Candidates interested in becoming a wind turbine mechanic in Arizona will be glad to know that the sections below contain everything they'll need to launch their careers properly. This includes everything from basic prerequisites to educational requirements, possible training programs, certification requirements, salary projections, and more.

## **How to Become a Wind Turbine Mechanic in Arizona**

The following are the most important steps in starting a wind turbine mechanic career in Arizona.

**Academic Education**

The first step in starting a career as a wind turbine mechanic in Arizona is to secure admission into a training program. It is typical for training institutions to ask that candidates possibly get a diploma from high school or a GED.

Once admission is secured, candidates will spend two years acquiring extensive training regarding fundamental and advanced topics in wind turbine technology. They will spend most of their time in the classroom, but some programs have provisions for hands-on training in laboratories or the real world.

Two-year colleges and technical schools typically offer academic wind turbine mechanic programs. Some may also last 6 months and offer a certificate instead of an associate degree.

**Real-World Training**

Even though, as mentioned above, it is common for some programs to have provisions for hands-on training in laboratories or the real world, more is needed to start a full-fledged career. For this reason, candidates set aside some time for further real-world experience.

It is possible to secure employment before completing real-world training, as most employers are willing to offer on-the-job training for fresh wind turbine mechanics in Arizona.

**Certification**

Certification is not a necessary component of being a wind turbine mechanic. Most candidates choose to earn one anyway because it gives them an edge when securing contracts and employment with the best establishments in the area.

**Getting Hired**

Candidates who have completed the above steps will have a significant edge in the job market. They can secure employment fast and improve their prospects by taking advantage of continuing education opportunities.
