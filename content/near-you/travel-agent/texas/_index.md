## **How to Become a Travel Agent in Texas**

Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the process required to become a travel agent in Texas.

**Basic Requirements**

Texas travel agents typically start their careers by having a high school diploma or GED and attending a training program. They are also expected to develop transferable interpersonal, planning, budgeting, and communication skills.

**Becoming Familiar with the Travel Industry**

Even before enrolling in a training program, an aspiring travel agent in Texas should have acquired some understanding of the travel industry. This includes knowledge of geography and itinerary on a fundamental level.

**Getting Formal Training**

An aspiring travel agent needs to acquire relevant training in their fields. They may do so by spending a few months to two years in a trade school.

They may also choose to enroll in four-year programs and earn a bachelor's degree instead.

**Becoming Certified**

Certification is optional for travel agents in Texas. Those who earn it do so because it offers several career opportunities.

Employers tend to gravitate towards agents who are already certified, while certification also gives access to continuing education resources and professional networking opportunities.

**Finding a Host Agency**

After acquiring the necessary expertise to carry out their duties, and possibly after choosing a specialty area, a fresh travel agent in Texas may concern themselves with securing job placement at a host agency.

Host agencies provide resources, including booking systems, IATA numbers, partner programs, marketing tools, and more advanced training.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

Texas travel agents are expected to receive a license from the state after they can practice legally. However, they are expected to have a unique IATA number.

A travel agent may utilize an IATA number provided by their host agency if they do not have an agency.

As for certification, as mentioned above, agents are encouraged to have one simply due to the sheer number of benefits and opportunities it provides.

The ***American Society of Travel Advisors, the International Air Transport Association***, the ***Travel Industry Designator Service***, and the ***Cruise Lines International Association*** are some of the most prominent options to consider.
