## **How to Become a Travel Agent in California**

The following are the steps needed to become a travel agent in California.

**High School Diploma or GED**

The state of California only makes it necessary for travel agents to possess a high school diploma or GED before they can start their careers. However, those who choose to go through academic training are usually advised to have one anyway to make their admission process a lot easier.

**Specialization**

Travel agents may specialize in several sub-disciplines, and interested candidates would do well to start considering their specialty areas right from the start. Possible options include working as a destination specialist, cruise specialist, adventure travel specialist, and luxury travel specialist.

**Training Arrangements**

Most travel agents take courses at community colleges and earn associate degrees in travel or tourism for formal training. However, taking courses online or enrolling in a college/university to earn a bachelor's degree in business management is also possible.

An upcoming section below highlights California's best training programs for future travel agents.

**Certification**

Just like it is with having a high school diploma, travel agents in California are only sometimes expected to acquire certification. However, many choose to become certified anyway because it offers several advantages, such as networking opportunities and continuing education.

In the next section, we will look at some options to consider as a travel agent looking to become certified in California.

***The International Air Transport Association, the Travel Industry Designator Service, and the Cruise Lines International Association*** are other notable organizations offering professional credentials to travel agents in California.

For state licensure, a travel agent in the state must have a unique IATA number. Agents who work as part of an existing agency can use their host agency's IATA number.

They are, however, still expected to obtain a "seller of travel" license by registering with the state.
