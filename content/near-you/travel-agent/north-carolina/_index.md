Future travel agents in North Carolina are advised to follow the steps below to start their careers on the right foundation.

**Acquiring Training**

Naturally, the most important step in becoming a travel agent is to acquire training. To do so, candidates often need a high school diploma or GED at the very least.

Nowadays, having some level of postsecondary training is crucial. For these, candidates may enroll in colleges and apply for either 2-year programs, 4-year programs, or even less.

During their training, candidates are expected to gain relevant skills in areas such as international affairs, marketing, budgeting, tourism, business practices, and more.

Anyone looking to become a travel agent must also be exceptional with research, as they will have to figure out ways to save on spending by finding the best deals on hotels, flights, and cruises, among others.

**Certification & Employment**

Lastly, after all of these steps are complete, candidates may go on to pursue certification and secure employment.

While certification is not mandatory by the state or employers, it is widely believed that certified travel agents are typically more favored when it comes to securing employment and leveraging career growth opportunities.
