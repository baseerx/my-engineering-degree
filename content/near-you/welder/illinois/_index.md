For their efforts, welders in Illinois are rewarded with an impressive salary, constant demand, and enormous opportunities for growth.

The pathway to starting a career in the field is also relatively straightforward for aspiring welders in the state. First, you will have to understand the different types of welding and then enroll in a training institution. Lastly, you will also have to fulfill the licensure requirements to start getting contracts or seeking employment from notable companies in the area.

## **How to Become a Welder in Illinois**

There are three general steps involved in becoming a welder in Illinois. These include the preparatory steps, the technical training steps, and the associated skill requirements.

We take a look at all of these below.

**Preparatory Steps**

The first thing you must do on your journey to become a welder in Illinois is to ensure you meet the basic requirements. This includes being at least 18 and having your high school diploma or GED ready.

Another important preparatory step is to ensure you know the areas of specialization involved in welding.

Ultimately, you will have to choose one or more of these areas yourself, and knowing what they are from the start will help in the future.

Among the most common types of welding include MIG welding, TIG welding, and oxy-acetylene welding, among others.

**Technical training**

Technical training to learn actual welding skills can be obtained from trade schools and community colleges with welding programs, and it can also be obtained through apprenticeship programs.

Those looking for a structured classroom environment will prefer attending technical college programs, while those looking for hands-on training usually gravitate towards apprenticeship programs.

Of course, it is possible to combine both by first graduating from a formal training program and then spending a few months in an apprenticeship program to obtain more hands-on training.

**Associated Skills**

Lastly, an aspiring welder will need additional skills not strictly about welding alone. These include critical thinking, problem-solving, attention to detail, time management, interpersonal skills, commitment to growth, safety awareness, and physical stamina.

## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

The state of Illinois does not have mandatory licensing requirements for its welders. With a high school diploma or GED and graduation from a training program, they can seek other employment and work in any establishment of their choice.

It is worth mentioning, however, that most welders in Illinois still choose to get certified by the American Welding Society not because it is mandated by law but because it gives them an edge and allows them to showcase proof of their expertise to prospective employers.
