## **How to Become a Welder in Florida**

**Areas of Specialization**

A career as a welder in Florida usually starts with understanding the different welding forms. Only after understanding the other areas of specialization can you focus on one or more of these areas.

The most popular forms of welding include MIG welding, TIG welding, hyperbaric welding, and oxy-acetylene welding, among others.

**Basic Requirements**

After choosing an area of specialization, the next step an aspiring welder in Florida needs to worry about is the basic requirements to enroll in a training program.

Usually, this includes having a high school diploma or a GED equivalent. Experience in mathematics, geometry, and measurements also helps during the program.

**Training Programs**

The most crucial step in starting any occupation is the trading aspect. Only those who have been appropriately trained can succeed in any field, including welding.

To ensure the best quality education, it is highly advisable for aspiring welders to first enroll in a training program run by a trade school or college in the state and then spend a few months in an apprenticeship program acquiring real-world experience.

**Trade School vs Apprenticeships**

While formal and apprenticeship programs try to incorporate as much classroom training and hands-on experience, they usually lean more toward one way than another.

By combining both, you ensure that you get the best of both worlds.

Additionally, those who have completed a training program need not spend years in an apprenticeship program. Thanks to their prior training, they can simply spend only a few months.

## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

To start working as a welder in Florida, an aspiring welder must only complete a training or apprenticeship program. The state has no law mandating welders to register with any particular board or organization before they can start working.

Despite no formal licensing requirement, welders in Florida still choose to get certified anyway simply because it helps them demonstrate their proficiency to employers and may qualify them for higher salaries and better career opportunities.

One of Florida's most popular welder certification alternatives is the American Welding Society *Certified Welder* credential.
