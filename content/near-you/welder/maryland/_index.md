Below are the key considerations involved in starting a welding career in the state of Maryland.

**Develop Non-Technical Skills & Attributes**

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

Welders in Maryland are expected to obtain a license after they can secure employment and start working legally. This will be pleasant news for those who want to avoid state licensing examinations.

However, candidates may have to sit for professional examinations anyway, especially if they want to become certified. Certification is attractive as it helps candidates stand out.

Having credentials also makes professional networking easier while opening up access to continuing education resources. A fresh welder looking to become certified in Maryland may consider any nationally recognized certificates offered by the American Welding Society (AWS).
