## **How to Become a Welder in Tennessee**

The following are the requirements to start a successful welding career in Tennessee.

**Basic Requirements**

Aspiring welders in Tennessee must meet the basic requirements leading up to actual skills acquisition. The first point of focus here should be physical fitness and sound health.

From there, candidates can concern themselves with the basic educational requirements, which are the possession of a high school diploma/GED and proficiency in basic mathematics and physics.

**Academic Training**

Academic training prepares individuals for welding careers through classroom and laboratory training. Most community colleges and trade schools in the state offer such programs, some of which we will be examining below.

Candidates looking to acquire welding training from an academic destination may also choose between certificate programs lasting for a few months and associate degree programs lasting for a few years.

**On-the-Job Training**

Instead of attending a community college, aspiring welders in Tennessee may simply enroll in an apprenticeship program. They will still have to meet the basic requirements above, but they will focus more on hands-on training in real-world work environments.

Some apprenticeship programs may offer candidates a stipend for their efforts and possible job placement assistance upon graduation.

**Preparing for Certification**

To prepare for their careers and enjoy professional opportunities such as networking and continuing education, welders in Tennessee are often advised to pursue certification.

They may apply for any of the options we discuss below.
