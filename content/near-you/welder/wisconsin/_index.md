## **How to Become a Welder in Wisconsin**

Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the key requirements to become a welder in Wisconsin.

**Basic Requirements**

Typically, a welder in Wisconsin is usually someone with a high school diploma or GED. This is because either of these is needed for enrollment into a training program.

While not a requirement, candidates are also encouraged to become familiar with possible specialty areas such as SMAW and GTAW before starting their training programs.

**Academic Training**

Welding training programs may lead to a certificate, associate degree, or bachelor's degree. While certificate programs can be completed within a few months or a year, associate degree programs take two years. Bachelor's degree programs last for 4 years.

**Apprenticeship Training**

Candidates who want to avoid acquiring academic welding training in Wisconsin may opt for an apprenticeship program. Apprenticeship welding training is an “on-the-job” training arrangement where candidates learn the skills to secure employment in real-world situations.

Students may also be expected to participate in classroom sessions, depending on the program. An apprenticeship welding program may require up to 4 years of training.
