In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, welders enjoy a high employment and income rate. They can also take advantage of numerous initiatives for career growth and earn a better annual average income.

To start their journeys, candidates are expected to attend a training program. Identifying the best available options may be difficult, so we have provided the comprehensive list below.

Other than giving key details about each program, the list below also identifies some key topics, curriculum, and notable features that candidates should always look out for when choosing the right training destination for top-quality education in welding technology.

Before we dive into the list, however, here's a quick highlight of the steps required to become a welder in Wisconsin.

## **How to Become a Welder in Milwaukee**

To become a welder in Milwaukee, candidates must be at least 18. They must also have a high school diploma or GED. From there, they must apply for an apprenticeship or formal training program at a college or trade school.

Where to apply between these two options is usually down to personal preference. But it is worth mentioning that both destinations have their benefits over the other.

Of course, it is also possible to combine both options. A popular route, for example, is to attend an academic training program first and then complete an apprenticeship program for more extensive training in the real world.

The state of Milwaukee does not mandate certification for its welders. However, professionals in this field seek certification from the *AWS (American Welding Society*). To earn these credentials, candidates must pass an AWS certification exam in their specialty area(s) and renew their credentials through continuing education.
