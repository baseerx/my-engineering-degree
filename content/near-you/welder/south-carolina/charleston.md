## **How to Become a Welder in Charleston**

Welders in Charleston start their careers by enrolling in a top-quality training program. There are a few choices in this regard: academic programs and apprenticeship programs.

While academic programs offer certificates and associate degrees, apprenticeship programs offer direct opportunities to learn on the job, possibly with the potential of being paid in the learning process.

Candidates should have a high school diploma or a GED equivalent to gain admission into these training destinations, be it an academic or apprenticeship.

Once they're done with training, candidates in Charleston don't have to become licensed to start working professionally. However, they may consider the professional certification the American Welding Society offers on their own accord.
