## **How to Become a Welder in Minneapolis**

In Minneapolis, welders are not expected to be licensed or certified by the state before practicing their craft. All that is needed is for candidates to go through the general steps required to obtain training and secure employment.

Typically, this includes applying for a training program of choice and fulfilling the employers' requirements.

Candidates must be 18 and have a high school diploma or GED. As for the actual training programs, aspiring welders in Minneapolis may choose to attend an apprenticeship program wherein they will hone their skills under the tutelage of master welders in real-world situations or opt for academic training at a trade school or community college.

The latter typically involves classroom training sprinkled with hands-on training in laboratories and workshops. Candidates may also become certified by the *American Welding Society* for professional opportunities.
