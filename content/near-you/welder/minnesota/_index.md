## **How to Become a Welder in Minnesota**

The following are the requirements for becoming a welder in Minnesota.

**Basic Educational Requirements**

While you don't necessarily have to earn an advanced degree to become a welder in Minnesota, employers and training programs appreciate candidates who at least have a high school diploma or GED.

**On-the-Job Training Requirements**

Candidates in Minnesota may take advantage of on-the-job training opportunities like apprenticeship programs for their actual technical training.

Some of the best welding apprenticeship programs are offered by unions and professional organizations in the state. They tend to last between 2 - 4 years to complete.

One of the advantages of these programs is that candidates get hands-on training and possible job placement assistance.

**Academic Training Requirements**

Candidates may attend a welding technology training program offered by a trade school instead of an apprenticeship program. They may also choose to attend these programs to consolidate their initial training.

Academic programs offer certificates and associate degrees that are valuable for career growth. They also offer advanced training for those who would like to specialize further.

**Employment**

Most welders in Minnesota work in manufacturing facilities. Their expertise will be required to work with metal components for airplanes, pipes, machinery, and other equipment.

Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Rochester are some of Minnesota's cities with the biggest demand for welders.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

The state of Minnesota does not have mandatory licensing requirements for its welders. With a high school diploma or GED and graduation from a training program, candidates can seek employment and practice their crafts in any establishment of choice.

It is worth iterating, however, that most welders in the state will still choose to get certified anywhere. They often choose to obtain credentials from the *American Welding Society* not because it is compulsory by law but because it provides them with an edge and lends credibility to their expertise, which is usually appealing to prospective employers.

Additionally, getting certified by AWS can help pave the way for better career opportunities and make it easier to practice in other states where AWS certification is mandatory.
