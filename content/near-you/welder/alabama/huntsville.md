## **How to Become a Welder in Huntsville**

Candidates in Huntsville, Alabama, who want to start their welding careers the right way typically have to possess a high school diploma or GED and use it to enroll in a postsecondary institution. Those who don't want to go through the academic route may enroll in an apprenticeship program or any other arrangement offering training “on the job.”
