## **How to Become a Welder in Colorado**

Below are the steps involved in becoming a welder in Colorado.

**Step 1: Identify a Specialty Area**

Identifying a specialty area is usually something that candidates are advised to do at the start of their journeys. Even though it is possible to have a change of mind along the way, it usually helps to become familiar with the various options right from the start.

**Step 2: Have your High School Diploma or GED**

Once candidates identify which kind of welding specialization they want, the next major step is to fulfill the basic educational requirements needed for that specialty.

Most training programs will ask candidates to have at least a high school diploma or GED before enrolling in their institutions. It also helps greatly in understanding basic topics in mathematics and geometry.

**Step 3: Enroll in a Top Training Program**

Lastly, candidates may enroll in a training program for welding skills. Usually, they will receive training in general welding before possible specialist topics.

Candidates may receive welding training in Colorado from one of two places: one is from academic programs, while the other option is to enroll in an apprenticeship program.

Both training are valid as long as they provide classroom and hands-on experience, possibly in a real-world environment.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

Colorado remains one of the states with statewide licensing requirements for welders. This means that candidates simply have to follow the steps above, secure employment, and they may begin to work legally in the state.

Of course, it is common to see certified welders in Colorado. Most of these professionals, however, choose to become certified of their own accord, thanks to the numerous benefits of doing so.

The American Welding Society, for example, offers a *Certified Welder* credential that helps candidates stand out and attain a degree of credibility typically appealing to potential employers. The credential requires attaining a passing score in a professional examination.

Because it requires continuing education to maintain, candidates also enjoy the benefit of being ahead in the field.
