Most people will tell you that welders join metals together if you ask anyone what a welder does. And while they'd technically be right, they would also be missing the point about the overall complexity of being a welder.

Yes, welders join metals together, but they do so in several ways, using complex methods and techniques to fabricate truly magnificent structures. And to do this, an aspiring welder has to undergo significant training.

Currently, welders are in great demand in Alaska, and the career outlook there is quite positive. But how exactly can you become one and take advantage of the field's enormous potential?

We take a comprehensive look below.

## **How to Become a Welder in Alaska**

Becoming a welder in Alaska requires completing a training program and becoming certified. However, sandwiched before and after these crucial steps are other important ones you would want to consider.

We provide a step-by-step guide on the whole process below.

**Step 1: Become Familiar with the Types of Welding**

To become a welder, you have to get trained and get certified. But before all of that, you have to be familiar with what the job entails in the first place.

There are different kinds of welders, but on the whole, they can be grouped into four major categories.

**Welding Categories**

* **Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW)** - Also known as a metal inert gas (MIG), this form of welding is commonly used for metal joints in general applications. Examples include automobiles, steel components, bridges, and ships.
* **Shielded-Metal Arc Welding (SMAW)** - Shielded-metal arc welding is a simple and popular form mainly used for fabricating small components. It finds application in home projects, repairs, and construction jobs.
* **Flux-Coated Arc Welding (FCAW)** - Flux-coated arc welding is a form of welding where a flux-cored electrode is directed through a welding gun. It is most famous for its mass production lines.
* **Gas Tungsten Arc Welding or TIG Welding** - TIG welding joins aluminum, magnesium, brass alloys, and copper components. Highly skilled welders mainly use it.

**Step 2: Complete a Training Program**

Training programs are essential for anyone looking to become a welder without prior knowledge or experience. Interested candidates must possess a high school diploma or equivalent to enroll in a training program.

Once enrolled, students must complete a 10 to 18 months training program to earn a certificate upon completion. This certificate is usually enough to practice as a welder in several industries.

Of course, those who wish to go further can do so by following the following step below.

**Step 3: Consider an Associate's Degree**

An associate's degree is not a mandatory requirement to become a welder, but it can improve your job prospects by making you more appealing to employers.

Apart from the appeal, associate's degree programs go deeper in their lessons and always incorporate a body of coursework that certificate programs can't match.

Among these subjects are OSHA safety procedures and regulations, structural design, and precision measurement.

**Step 4: Apprenticeship Programs**

It is always advisable to consolidate your certificate with an apprenticeship. This way, you can add real-world, hands-on knowledge to the skills you have acquired in a training program. While getting paid as an apprentice is possible, try to expect something manageable in this regard.

**Step 5: Certification**

Finally, after completing a training program and an apprenticeship, you next want to become certified. While the state does not have a stringent certification requirement, getting one is always a good idea, as it can significantly increase job prospects.

Welder certification is carried out by the American Welding Society (AWS), and options include Certified Welder (CW), Certified Welding Inspector (CWI), Certified Welding Supervisor (CWS), and Certified Welding Engineer (CWE), among others.
