Welders in Hawaii enjoy a very high demand that is projected to grow even higher. This, of course, is good news for anyone looking to become a welder in the state. And to make things even better, growing demand is not the only reason a career as a welder in Hawaii is so appealing.

Among other things, this group of professionals also enjoy an incredible level of job security, flexibility, the ability to branch out and start their own business, and of course, an impressive annual average salary for contractors.

But how exactly does one become a welder in Hawaii? What are the steps involved? Are there certification/licensing laws for welders nationwide or specific to the state? And what are some top programs to consider?

We provide detailed answers to these questions and more in the upcoming sections below.

## **How to Become a Welder in Hawaii**

Becoming a welder in Hawaii requires following a handful of steps similar to other states. First, you enroll in a training program, but to enroll in a training program, a high school diploma or GED equivalent is necessary.

Once admitted into the program of your choice, you may need to spend up to a couple of years learning the fundamentals of crucial areas such as Tungsten Inert Gas (TiG), Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), and Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW).

From here, the next step is gathering hands-on experience on the job. Some training programs incorporate this into their curriculum, while others expect graduates to fulfill this requirement independently through apprenticeship programs.

## **Top Welder Schools in Hawaii**

Vetting by educational standards, quality of facilities and instructors, along with the comprehensiveness of coursework and other factors, below are some of the most prominent welder schools in Hawaii.

**1\. Hawaii Community College**

Hawaii Community College has two separate programs for aspiring welders in the area. The first is an associate of applied science degree program in Machine, Welding, and Industrial Mechanics Technologies that can be completed in two years.

The second is a certificate of achievement and competence program that can be completed in four months.

The program also has two separate campuses in Kailua Kona and Hilo and boasts top-quality instructors.

The tuition cost ranges between $2000 to $8,777, which already includes books and supplies.

**2\. Honolulu Community College**

Like Hawaii Community College, Honolulu Community College boasts an incredibly robust welding program. The program can last between 1 year to 2 years, depending on whether students go for the *Associate of Applied Science in Welding program* or the *Certificate of Achievement in Welding program,* which can go on for up to a year.

Tuition costs $3,698 per semester, with an additional $1,500 for books and supplies.

**3\. Kauai Community College**

*3-1901 Kaumualii HWY Lihue, HI 96766*

## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

Welders in Hawaii have to obtain a C-56 Welding Contractor license from the state before they can begin to work and take on contracts. The application fee will set you back by $50, while the examination fee is $75.

Welders in Hawaii may also choose to become certified, but only because it often gives them an edge in seeking employment. Most people become certified via the American Welding Society (AWS).

Those who go in this direction may pursue a Certified Welder, Certified Welding Educator, Certified Welding Inspector, or Certified Welding Engineer credentials, among others.

Those who wish to pursue a different certification from the ones offered by AWS may consider credentials from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

## **Salary and Job Outlook**

Welders in Hawaii are among the highest earners in the field nationwide. They earn a mean annual salary of $61,286. In context, this number is about 34% higher than the national average for other states.

It is worth mentioning that the salary you may earn as a welder in Maine will probably be higher or lower than this figure, depending on several factors, including your experience level, establishment type, and location.

Starting, you will likely fall into the lower spectrum of earners and take home around $46,486 annually. Once all factors have been optimized, you may eventually fall into the top ten percent of welders in the state and earn as high as $80,800.

The highest-paying cities include Honolulu, Pearl Harbor, and Kapolei, with an average annual salary of $61,688, $49,004, and $46,646, respectively.
