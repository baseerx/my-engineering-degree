## **How to Become a Welder in Pennsylvania**

**Basic Requirements**

The first step to becoming a welder is to fulfill the basic requirements. For individuals in Pennsylvania, these include being at least 18 years old, being able to read and write the English language proficiently, and having a good moral character.

A high school diploma or GED is also necessary to secure admission into training and apprenticeship programs.

**Know your Welding Fields**

The second step on your path to becoming a welder in Pennsylvania would be to become familiar with the different areas of specialization involved in the job. Welding is a broad term that involves numerous techniques such as TIG welding, SMAW, GTAW, TiG, oxy-acetylene welding, and hyperbaric welding, among others.

It pays to become familiar with these techniques on a fundamental level even before enrolling in a training program.

**Enrolling in a Training Program**

Enrolling in a training program is undoubtedly the most essential part of becoming a welder. As you'll see below, there are numerous training programs for aspiring welders in Pennsylvania to consider.

Usually, these are divided into two formal and apprenticeship training programs.

**Formal Training Programs**

Formal training programs are programs offered by trade schools, vocational schools, and colleges of all sorts. Usually, individuals enroll in traditional training programs because they provide a structured environment to learn about theoretical principles and gain hands-on experience through laboratory and workshop sessions.

They also make it easy to secure employment with a degree.

**Apprenticeship Programs**

Unions usually run apprenticeship training programs but sometimes can be organized by non-union organizations and even government initiatives. The highlight of apprenticeship programs is that they provide rigorous and hands-on training in real-world environments.

Applicants who complete an apprenticeship program may find securing employment with that organization easier.
