## **How to Become a Welder in Arizona**

The following are the steps needed to become a welder in Arizona.

**Have a High School Diploma or GED**

A high school diploma or GED is crucial to becoming a welder in Arizona. This is not necessarily based on state law but on requirements set by employers, apprenticeships, and other training programs.

**Acquire Relevant Skills**

Future welders in Arizona are expected to be strong and in good physical condition. They are also expected to obtain relevant skills from a training arrangement.

The following are some worthy options.

**Formal Academic Training**

Formal welding training can be acquired through academic institutions such as vocational schools and community colleges. These programs teach introductory and advanced welding topics like safety practices and metal fabrication.

Ultimately, they also offer valuable certificates and associate degrees that make graduates more appealing to potential employers.

**On-the-Job Training**

In addition to their academic training, candidates may also receive training on the job from an apprenticeship or a willing employer.

The advantage here is the opportunity for mentorship and immersive, hands-on training right from the start. It is also possible for those who acquire training on the job to be paid for their contributions.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

In Arizona, welders are not expected to obtain a license from the state or local bodies before starting their careers. The same applies to certification, but candidates often go for one anyway, thanks to the career benefits.

Among other things, certification opens the door for career growth through networking. It also appeals to most employers because it forces candidates to keep improving through continuing education and access to quality materials and resources.

The **American Welding Society** offers the most popular credentials across the country. This includes the ***Certified Welder*** credential and others in areas such as SMAW, GTAW, and GMAW.

Candidates who work with mechanical components may also consider the credentials the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) offers.
