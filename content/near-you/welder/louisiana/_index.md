Welders are professionals who have trained for years to fabricate and manipulate strong metals using heat and other specialized equipment. And even though this may seem like a daunting task at first, the path to becoming a welder in Louisiana is quite straightforward.

As one would expect, the hardest and most important part is the training. But once this is complete, the additional requirements can be completed easily and should come naturally once you have obtained the right foundational knowledge from a training school.

To that end, we have provided an in-depth guide below containing key information on how to become a welder in Louisiana, including how to begin, the potential salary, and certification/licensure requirements.

## **How to Become a Welder in Louisiana**

Louisiana has a straightforward path for aspiring welders. First, a high school diploma or GED is required to gain admission into top programs and become certified.

Those with these credentials may proceed to enroll in any of the top programs in the state, including the ones we have listed below. From there, certification is the next important step.

No law requires all welders to be licensed, but it is still a highly advisable endeavor because it lends more credibility and makes employment seeking more convenient.

All in all, it takes around two years for most aspiring welders to complete all of these steps and begin their job search. Accelerated programs, of course, may take less time.
