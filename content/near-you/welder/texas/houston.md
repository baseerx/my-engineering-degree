For an aspiring welder in Houston, Texas, one of the most important decisions you can make for your career is to choose a worthwhile training program. Even though the state boasts of some of the most prominent training programs in the nation, it is still essential to consider the available options and pick the best.

Of course, it may be too stressful and time-consuming to sift through *all* the available options, but you don't have to worry because that is exactly what this article is for.

## **How to Become a Welder in Houston**

To become a welder in Houston, you must be at least 18 and have your high school diploma or GED. From there, you must apply for an apprenticeship or formal training program at a college or vocational training school.

The choice of which to apply for between the two is personal preference, as both have their benefits over the other. Of course, combining both options is possible by attending a training program first and then completing a few months in an apprenticeship program.

The state of Texas mandates certification by the AWS (American Welding Society), and as such, all potential welders in Houston must pass an AWS certification exam before they can practice professionally.
