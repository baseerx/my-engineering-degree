## **How to Become a Welder in Georgia**

Aspiring welders in Georgia must follow the steps below to kick-start their careers.

**Getting Ready for Training**

The first step to becoming a welder in Georgia is to prepare for admission into a training program. Candidates can qualify by having their high school diploma or GED sent to the training destination of choice. Additionally, they may brush up on specific foundational courses such as algebra, mathematics, and geometry.

**Choosing a Training Destination**

All aspiring welders in Georgia must choose not just the institution they wish to attend but also the kind of structure. For instance, candidates may choose to learn in an academic environment like a community college or vocational school, and they may also choose to learn from an apprenticeship program.

It is also possible to combine both training paradigms and gain the best of both worlds.

**Academic Programs vs Apprenticeships**

Academic programs and apprenticeships offer acceptable destinations to start a welding career in Georgia. However, the significant difference is that while educational programs focus on a classroom structure, apprenticeships prioritize hands-on training in a workshop environment.

Additionally, apprenticeship programs tend to last longer.

Candidates who receive training from academic programs may graduate with a certificate or an associate degree.

**Certification**

Lastly, to begin their career and set themselves apart from the competition, aspiring welders in Georgia may also consider obtaining certification from the American Welding Society. We look at some of the most popular credentials to apply for.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

Welders in Georgia do not have to acquire a license on a statewide level. Certification, on the other hand, while not mandatory, can be beneficial. Employers, for instance, tend to gravitate more toward hiring certified welders.

As mentioned earlier, the American Welding Society is the most popular certifying body for welders in Georgia. The organization offers a certified welder credential to interested individuals. Candidates who apply for this location must pass an exam and renew their license every year.

Experience welders may also go for the Senior Certified Welding Inspector, Certified Welding Educator, or Certified Welding Supervisor credentials, among others.
