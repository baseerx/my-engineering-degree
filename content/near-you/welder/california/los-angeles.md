## **How Become a Welder in Los Angeles**

California has specific licensing requirements for contracting and non-contracting welders. Before this stage, however, individuals must have graduated from an accredited training program.

They may also become certified by the American Welding Society (AWS) to make it easier to secure employment or go for the QC7 certification, the state's equivalent of the AWS certification.
