## **How to Become a Solar Technician in Illinois**

The following are the steps in starting a solar technician career in Illinois.

**Step 1: High School Diploma or GED**

A high school diploma or GED equivalent is the primary educational requirement to become a solar technician in Illinois. This can even be enough to start a career without additional training. However, candidates are advised to consider the following steps below to give themselves the best chances.

**Step 2: Training Routes**

For their actual solar technology training, aspiring candidates in Illinois may consider the following approaches:

**Academic Programs**

Aspiring solar technicians may enroll in solar technology programs offered by community colleges and trade schools to receive their certificate or associate degree. This degree will give them better leverage in the employment market.

Along with obtaining a certificate, these programs allow candidates to acquire in-depth training in classroom environments and practical laboratories. Among the topics students will learn include introduction to solar power, system design, electrical components, and safety, among others.

**Apprenticeships**

Because the state of Illinois does not expect solar technicians to have a college degree before they can start working, it is also possible for these professionals to receive their training on the job.

Apprenticeship programs tend to focus heavily on this kind of training, but some apprenticeships also incorporate a great deal of classroom training, particularly in the beginning.

Additionally, some apprenticeship programs allow candidates to receive payments for their efforts even as they learn.

**Step 3: Consider Certification**

Just like an advanced education gives you an edge as an aspiring solar technician in Illinois, professional credentials also do the same. Below, we look at some of the most popular certification options for interested individuals.

Certification is optional for solar technicians in Illinois. Those who wish to take advantage of the opportunities they offer may acquire a NABCEP certification, which is often regarded as the gold standard in the industry.
