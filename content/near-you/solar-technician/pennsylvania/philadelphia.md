Solar technology has enjoyed an incredible boost in popularity in recent years. Moreover, the projection for the coming decade is even more favorable than ever.

Leading the charge of helping regular people take advantage of the power that this exciting technology has to offer are solar technicians who are responsible for installing and maintaining the components that make harnessing solar energy possible.

To perform their jobs at the very highest level, solar technicians in Philadelphia and anywhere else in the country must pass through an accredited training program.

In the list below, we look at some of the most popular training programs and the qualities that make them stand out.

## **How to Become a Solar Technician in Philadelphia**

Three things are most important for aspiring solar technicians in Philadelphia to consider. The first is the essential requirement needed to secure admission into a training program, the second is the type of training they would like to go for, and the third is the licensing requirement.

As for the essential requirement, most training programs only ask that candidates have a high school diploma or GED and proficiency in the English language.

The most common alternative for training options is to enroll in a college or vocational school or get training on the job. Lastly, solar technicians in Philadelphia are expected to obtain the license not on a statewide level but from their particular counties and municipalities.
