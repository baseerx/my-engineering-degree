## **How to Become a Solar Technician in Pennsylvania**

Solar technicians in Pennsylvania must meet a few basic requirements and then complete a training program before securing licensing and certification. The basic needs involve being a high school graduate with a diploma to show for it or having a GED equivalent in its place.

As for the training requirements, below are the three general methods by which an aspiring solar technician can obtain adequate training.

**On-the-Job Training**

Usually, on-the-job training is provided by employers willing to train their employees from the start, even if they have yet to gain prior experience. This is also the best approach for those with experience working in related Industries before shifting to solar technology.

**Apprenticeship Programs**

Additionally, on-the-job training is available through apprenticeship programs organized by unions and trade organizations. These programs don't necessarily equate to employment but simply serve as a means to bring up future solar technicians in a real-world environment under the supervision of experienced instructors.

**Technical Training Schools**

Lastly, colleges, trade schools, and vocational institutions also provide formal training programs for aspiring solar technicians to learn the craft in a structured environment.

Technical training programs incorporate many classroom training mixed with practical hands-on sessions.

**Complementary Skills**

Along with technical training from any of these places, solar technicians will have a better chance of success if they possess a handful of other skills.

These include physical stamina, attention to detail, a problem-solving mindset, the ability to see things differently, and safety-mindedness.
