Solar power remains the fastest-growing energy source - and for good reasons too. It is clean, renewable, and, in recent times, cost-effective and incredibly easy to access. Solar technicians are in more demand than ever for all these reasons.

But of course, to become a solar technician in Tucson, Arizona, and anywhere else, you must first obtain proper training from an approved institution. Knowing the best available options can be challenging, but that's where we come in.

Below we look at some of the very best solar technician schools in and around Tucson, Arizona, along with a few notes on what to look for in a solar tech school in the first place.

## **How to Become a Solar Technician in Tucson**

Becoming a solar technician in Tucson, Arizona, requires having a high school diploma or GED and a driver's license. Those with all of these can seek employment directly, even if they have little experience in the field.

They may acquire the rest of what they'll need on the job.

Those without experience may have to enroll in a college or vocational program. These programs are often fast-tracked and can be completed in under a year. But of course, some may take longer.

Certification is always welcome for solar technicians after training because it helps them stand out and may lead to higher pay. And while certification is optional, licensing is not.

All professional solar technicians in Tucson must obtain a license from the Arizona Registrar of Contractors.

### **1\. Pima Community College**

[Pima Community College](https://www.pima.edu/) in Tucson offers a high-quality Energy Technology Certificate program designed to train aspiring solar technicians nationwide. The program was developed along with Tucson Electric Power and Southwest Gas.

Students are prepared for employment as entry-level workers and may apply for the National Center for Construction Education and Research (NCCER) Essentials credentials once they graduate.

Successful applicants can choose between the Energy Technology Level I and the Energy Technology Level II Certificates.

### **2\. Arizona Western College**

Another viable option for aspiring solar technicians in Tucson looking for a high-quality training program nearby is the Solar Photovoltaic Installation program and certificate offered by Arizona Western College.

The school's team of experienced instructors provides training on topics such as basic electrical theory, panel positioning and tie-in to the commercial grid, proper code requirements, and more.

By graduating, students will have the skills to work as solar panel installers and pass the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) photovoltaic entry-level examination.
