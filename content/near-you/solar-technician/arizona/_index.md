## **How to Become a Solar Technician in Arizona**

**Step 1: Fulfill Basic Requirements**

The basic requirements for becoming a solar technician in Arizona involve having a high school diploma or GED and a driver's license. This ensures that candidates have a solid foundation in high school subjects such as mathematics, science, computer, and electronics.

**Step 2: Get Trained in Your Preferred Institution**

The most important aspect of becoming a solar technician is obtaining the necessary training to do the job at a high level. As one would expect, there are a few different approaches to consider. We discuss them below.

**On-the-Job Training**

The first approach to becoming a solar technician is to acquire the needed training on the job. This is possible because no law mandates formal college training for solar technicians.

Learning on the job is usually advisable for those who have had some experience working as electricians or related professions. This way, they get the niche training required to be a solar technician from master technicians with tons of experience.

**Advanced Degree**

Getting a certificate, associate degree, or even a bachelor's degree can be a good idea for upcoming solar technicians with no prior experience in this or related fields. And as expected, numerous college programs and specialized vocational schools offer these degrees.

Students who desire more flexibility may also enroll in an online or hybrid program.

**Step 3: Become Certified**

Certification is another aspect of becoming a solar technician that, even though valuable, is not legally mandated. Solar technicians choose to become certified because it gives them an edge over other candidates and allows them to improve through continuing education.

The options to consider in this regard are the certifications offered by the *Electronics Technicians Associations*, the *North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners,* and *Roof Integrated Solar Energy*.
