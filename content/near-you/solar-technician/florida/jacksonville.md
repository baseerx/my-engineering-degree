Students will train for 4,000 hours on the job and 296 hours in the classroom and online. Topics will include workplace safety, solar energy introduction, fundamentals of solar thermal, solar system designs, thermal and electric solar installation systems, layout, operation, maintenance, and troubleshooting.

To ensure they're ready for the business side of the profession, students are also taught about business development, solar sales, and customer service.

### 2\. Florida International Training Institute
