## **How to Become a Solar Technician in Florida**

**High School Diploma and GED**

Possessing a high school diploma or GED is one of the most fundamental requirements for becoming a solar technician in Florida. Those already considering a solar technology career from High School may get themselves ready by taking classes in Mathematics and science.

Shop classes and computer-related classes also help immensely.

**Educational Pathways**

Solar technicians in Florida often start their careers while going through one of two educational pathways. We take a look at both of these below.

**Completing an apprenticeship**

Becoming a solar technician in Florida is possible by completing an apprenticeship program. These programs last a few months and include much hands-on training. Along with working in a workshop simulating real-world scenarios, solar technicians in apprenticeship programs also get to go out into the real world and experience how actual installation projects work.

**Colleges and Technical Schools**

Another alternative to completing an apprenticeship program is to spend a few years in a college or technical program. These programs usually last 1 to 2 years and are great for acquiring the theoretical foundation and practical skills needed on the job.

Formal training programs include science, technology, engineering, and mathematics classes.

**Advanced Education**

Lastly, even though it is not mandatory, solar technicians in Florida may also consider advancing their education by pursuing bachelor's degrees in renewable energy, system design, solar technology, and more.

Certification is another way to improve yourself as a solar technician.
