## **How to Become a Solar Technician in Virginia**

The following are the key steps involved in starting a solar technician career in the state of Virginia.

**Basic Requirements**

Aspiring solar technicians in Virginia will be glad to know that the field has very few basic requirements to gain admission into a training program and secure employment. Most training institutions and employers may ask that candidates be at least 18 years old and have a high school diploma, but this is not a statewide law.

**Training Programs**

Solar technicians in Virginia all begin their careers by attending a training program. However, the particular program tends to differ based on individual preference.

While some prefer to obtain their training from an academic institution like the Piedmont Virginia Community College, others choose instead to enroll in an apprenticeship program.

Naturally, both training avenues are valid, and each has its benefits. Academic programs are thorough, and their degrees/certificates always appeal to potential employers.

Apprenticeship programs are also thorough, focusing on hands-on training and real-world experience. They may also allow students to earn while they're still learning.

**Certification**

Certification is another requirement not compulsory for a solar technician in Virginia but offers too many benefits to be ignored. It makes it easier to secure employment and gives professionals access to valuable resources that may be leveraged to improve and grow their careers.

**Secure Employment**

From here, candidates may secure employment by creating a resume highlighting their journey and applying for open positions. Some academic and apprenticeship programs offer job placement assistance to the best students.

## **Top Solar Technician Schools in Virginia**

The following institutions offer top-class training for aspiring solar technicians in Virginia.

**Piedmont Virginia Community College**

[Piedmont, Virginia Community College](https://www.pvcc.edu/) offers solar technology training thanks to its Workforce Training Center. Students learn key topics, including module analysis, safety, maintenance of PV systems, and more. Applicants must be at least 18 years old and sound in reading and writing English.

**Virginia Highlands Community College**

[Virginia Highlands Community College](https://www.vhcc.edu/) offers a solar technology training program called the Certificate in Solar Energy program. Students get to receive technical skills while also qualifying for professional credentials.

The program also maintains a purposefully small class size for an optimal ratio of students and instructors.

**Solairgen**

Solairgen offers online training for aspiring solar technicians all across the country. The school also makes provisions for candidates to receive hands-on training by partnering with specific centers in the state.

Candidates also receive professional credentials upon graduation, namely the NABCEP Associate Installer credential.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

Like most states, Virginia has no state-wide licensing requirements for solar technicians. Candidates in most parts of the state may begin their careers immediately after completing all of the above steps.

However, checking in with local regulatory bodies for a clearer picture at the municipality level is still advisable. For instance, Arlington County requires technicians to register and obtain a permit for some specific installation activities.

Concerning certification, candidates may look to NABCEP - the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners - for a highly respected Photovoltaic Installation credential. Not only does this increase job prospects, as stated earlier, but it also increases credibility and customer confidence in your service.
