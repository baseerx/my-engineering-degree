## **How to Become a Solar Technician in Texas**

The basic qualifications for becoming a solar technician in Texas include having a high school diploma or GED. This is not to say that solar technicians in the state do not have more than these credentials, but simply that these are the basis upon which they may build and acquire more education.

**Acquiring More Education**

Aspiring solar technicians in Texas with a high school diploma or GED may acquire proper training from an institution of choice.

Usually, there are two directions to go for this training. These include the following:

Even though this isn't mandatory, a degree usually goes a long way to set technicians apart, particularly regarding salary and securing employment in respectable establishments.

**On-the-Job training**

Solar technicians who want to avoid attending community or technical colleges may choose to acquire their training on the job. On-the-job training provides all the expertise needed to thrive as a solar technician, with the benefit of helping future solar technicians contact established professionals in the field who can act as mentors and guides.

**Additional Skills**

Apart from meeting the basic requirements and obtaining the necessary training, aspiring solar technicians in Texas must also have other additional skills, such as strong interpersonal skills, communication skills, technical skills, and physical stamina.
