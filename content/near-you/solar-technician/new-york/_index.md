## **How to Become a Solar Technician in New York**

The following are the steps involved in becoming a solar technician in New York, including the educational prerequisites, training alternatives, and career growth opportunities:

**Step 1: Have a High School Diploma or GED**

The first step in becoming a solar technician in New York – and anywhere else – is to have your high school diploma or GED ready. This is usually the essential educational requirement, after which candidates may then go on to obtain actual work training "on the job" or at a vocational school.

Even at the high school level, proficiency in STEM topics will also help along the road.

**Step 2: Obtain Adequate Training**

As mentioned above, because a high-school diploma or GED is the only educational requirement, aspiring solar technicians in New York can choose to acquire their training on the job.

On-the-job training can be obtained from employers willing to train technicians afresh without prior experience or from apprenticeship programs wherein students learn the trade for a few years under the supervision of established solar technicians.

Adequate training to become a solar technician can also be acquired from formal training programs offered by technical colleges, community colleges, trade schools, and other similar institutions.

**Step 3: Further Your Career**

Usually, solar technicians can further their careers by pursuing a more advanced degree to open up better work opportunities or even enter a more advanced field. Additionally, pursuing certifications is another viable pathway to facilitating career growth as a solar technician.
