## **How to Become a Solar Technician in Georgia**

Generally, the path to becoming a solar technician in Georgia involves having a high school diploma or GED and then acquiring actual solar technology training. However, seeing as there are no advanced educational requirements, candidates may obtain training on the job by working as assistants to actual solar technicians.

This way, they will receive all their training in actual job sites. However, those who want to give themselves even better leverage may consider enrolling in organized training programs such as academic programs and apprenticeships.

**Academic Solar Technology Training**

Community colleges and vocational schools can offer academic training for future solar technicians. These institutions have different arrangements which may lead to a diploma, certificate, or associate degree.

To gain admission into a training program of your choice, you will need a high school diploma or GED certificate. During your stay, you're most likely to receive extensive training in introduction to solar technology, electric wiring and circuits, reading schematics, and more.

Candidates are also expected to develop strong communication and interpersonal skills if needed.

**Solar Technician Apprenticeship**

Solar technician apprenticeships are commonly offered by trade unions, organizations, and government initiatives seeking to produce new batches of solar technicians in a specific area.

An important distinction between academic and apprenticeship programs is that the formal focus is heavily on classroom instructions with little hands-on training. In contrast, the latter focuses on hands-on training with some classroom instructions.

**Certification**

Lastly, after completing their actual solar technology training, aspiring solar technicians in Georgia may also seek professional credentials to give themselves more leverage in the employment market. We dive deeper into this subject below.
