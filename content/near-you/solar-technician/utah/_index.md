## **How to Become** a Solar Technician in Utah

There are a few different approaches to becoming a solar technician in Utah. Below is a broad overview of the steps involved, including the standard requirements and the various alternatives regarding education and training.

**Step 1: Having the Basic Prerequisites**

The prerequisites for becoming a solar technician in Utah include a high-school diploma or GED, a driver's license, and a safety-conscious approach to the job.

High School students who wish to become solar technicians are also advised to take mathematics, science, and computer science classes.

**Step 2: Enrolling in a Training Program**

When it comes to getting trained as a solar technician, there are usually two different approaches. The first is to obtain training on the job, while the second is to attend a college or trade school program before seeking employment.

**Training on the Job**

Aspiring solar technicians who wish to start working as fast as possible may consider getting their training on the job. Several companies, unions, and organizations offer this opportunity in the state.

Apart from obtaining valuable hands-on training, those who go with this approach may also get mentorship from established master technicians while they work.

**College Training**

Colleges and vocational schools in Utah offer formal training programs for aspiring solar technicians. These programs usually last for a year or two, depending on the certificate/degree in sight.

An advantage of this approach is that it offers a solid theoretical foundation and a more considerable appeal to potential employers.

**Step 3: Becoming Certified**

The Electronics Technicians Association offers certifications in numerous electronics fields. Solar technicians may apply for the *Photovoltaic Installer - Level 1* certification the association provides.

This certification, of course, is not mandated by the state but doing so can help professionals secure employment easier and qualify for higher pay.

Those who desire a different certification may go with the ones offered by the *North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners* (NABCEP) and *Roof Integrated Solar Energy* (RISE).

**Step 4: Obtaining State License**

The last step to becoming a solar technician in Utah is obtaining a state license. The certification and licensing requirements section below provides more details on this topic.
