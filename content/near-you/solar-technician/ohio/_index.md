## **How to Become a Solar Technician in Ohio**

Usually, aspiring solar technicians in Ohio are advised to have a high school diploma or equivalent to enter the field. But of course, someone with a higher degree will have better prospects than someone with a high school diploma.

For this reason, candidates tend to apply for an associate degree at community colleges and trade schools.

**College Programs**

A typical college or trade school solar technology program will teach students the fundamentals of solar power along with other critical topics in system design and safety. Candidates will graduate with a certificate or a degree that they can leverage to secure employment at the best establishment in the area.

Some training programs offer part-time and full-time arrangements, while receiving solar technology training at online destinations is also possible.

In one of the upcoming sections, we will look at some of the most notable training programs for aspiring solar technicians in the area to consider.

**On-the-Job Training**

Without attending an academic program, aspiring solar technicians in Ohio may choose to participate in any training program that allows them to learn while they work. For instance, apprenticeship programs often incorporate this kind of arrangement.

Even though students may start with some classroom instructions, the bulk of the training will be focused on hands-on instructions that allow them to get their *hands on* actual solar components as quickly as possible.

Additionally, such an arrangement may allow candidates to make some money even while they are learning the craft.

After training, candidates may consider other vital specifications, such as the certification and licensure requirements, which we discuss below.

Candidates must acquire a commercial photovoltaic electrical license to work on commercial buildings that use solar panels to generate energy. Candidates must obtain a state contractor HVAC license to work on commercial buildings that use solar panels to develop power and heat the building.

Additionally, to enjoy the benefits of having a professional credential, solar technicians in Ohio may consider applying for a [NABCEP](https://www.nabcep.org/certifications/) certification.
