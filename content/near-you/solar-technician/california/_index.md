It is no secret that climate change has forced the world to double down on renewable and sustainable energy sources. And among the numerous options coming up at the moment, solar power remains one of the most promising.

While solar panels have been around for decades, they have seen a rejuvenated interest in the last few years that has not only made them appealing to more individuals and businesses but has also reduced their costs by as much as 70% in this short time span.

In California, particularly, solar power is becoming more and more popular by the day. And, of course, for individuals looking to tap into this power source, the only way to do so is to employ the expertise of professionals trained in solar power installation and maintenance. And this is where solar technicians come in.

## **What do Solar Technicians Do?**

Solar technicians assemble, install, maintain, and upgrade solar panels as required. Solar installation is no walk in the park as it requires a lot of technical configuration and the use of specialized tools. It also takes its physical toll thanks to hours spent standing, climbing, crouching, and carrying panels.

For those who would like to become solar technicians in California, there is solace in the fact that the field continues to grow with increased demand each day. What's more, the salary remains attractive with an upwards motion.

So how exactly does one become a solar technician in California? Well, we take an in-depth look in the following sections.

## **Steps to Become a Solar Technician in California**

Becoming a solar technician in California is quite straightforward. In addition to the general steps uniform to anyone looking to become a solar technician in any state, there are also a few state-specific requirements.

We take a look at all of these below.

**Step 1: Becoming Eligible**

To become a solar technician in California, you will have to get certified by a professional organization, get licensed, and obtain some kind of training (not necessarily in that order). All of these steps usually have some general requirements.

The first is that all applicants must have a GED or equivalent. The second is that they must have a valid driver's license. Additionally, they must also have strong interpersonal and communication skills.

**Step 2: Formal Education**

A lot of solar technicians choose to attend formal programs in colleges and vocational institutes. Even though there is another approach, as you'll see below, this particular path is attractive as it allows you to learn in detail about the progress that's continually made in the field. Certain employers in the state also often tend to favor candidates with a formal degree.

**Step 3: Completing Hands-on Training**

Instead of enrolling in a formal education program, it is possible to become a solar technician by participating in an apprenticeship program. This path is appealing for its emphasis on hands-on training that pretty much immerses you in how real-world professionals go about their day-to-day tasks from the start.

Companies and organizations usually offer apprenticeship programs, and they can take different amounts of time to complete.

## **Licensing and Certification Requirements**

Anyone looking to become a solar technician in California will do well to consider getting certified. It should be said, however, that certification is merely encouraged, not mandated.

It is encouraged, first of all, because certified technicians get to enjoy a handful of perks, including access to organizational structure and continuing education, among others. Secondly, some employers value certified technicians over those who are not.

**NABCEP Certification**

While there are a few certification bodies worthy of consideration for solar technicians in California, NABCEP - the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners - is, without a doubt, the most popular in the state.

To become NABCEP certified, candidates must complete a handful of courses and pass the appropriate exam for their specialization. The most popular is the PV Installation Professional (PVIP) certification.

**Obtaining a License**

To start getting contracts in California, a solar technician is expected to obtain the appropriate license, which is the C-46 Contractors License, "A" General Contractor, or "B" General Building Contractor's License.

For these, interested applicants must be. $330 application fee and a $200 initial licensing fee. Candidates must also fulfill other requirements, such as 4 years of work experience and absence of criminal history.
