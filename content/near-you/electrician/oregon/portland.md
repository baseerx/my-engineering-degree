To become an electrician in Portland, Oregon, you must attend a proper training school. Choosing the right electrician training school, however, can be quite challenging - but it doesn't have to be.

Once you understand the things to look out for, the entire process becomes a lot smoother. Among other things, electrician schools have the best facilities, world-class instructors, and a focus on integrating hands-on training with classroom sessions.

## **How to Become an Electrician in Portland**

Before we go into the best training options for aspiring electricians in Portland, it is worth mentioning how to begin the journey in the first place.

To become an electrician in Portland, you need a license from the Oregon Building Codes Division Office (BCD). This is for electricians who will be working as non-contactors.

For electricians who will be working directly as contractors, they will have to obtain additional licenses from the Oregon Construction Contractors Board.

Of course, before all this, an aspiring electrician must first obtain the right level of training. This can be done from a trade school or an apprenticeship program.

We list some of the most noteworthy options in this regard below.
