All electricians in Oregon must obtain a high level of training before they can start practicing professionally. There are quite a few options in this regard, each with its own benefits and peculiar edge over the other. Ultimately, your direction to obtain your training will be based on your preference.

One of the most popular approaches, however, is to attend a trade program offered by a college or other postsecondary institutions. Another approach is to attend a vocational/trade school. Once you're done with the program, you may move on to the next important step, which is to become licensed and certified.

## **How to Become an Electrician in Oregon**

There are three key steps involved in becoming an electrician in Oregon. Firstly, you must meet the prerequisites for enrolling in a trade program or apprenticeship. These include familiarity with topics in algebra and physics, along with possessing a high school diploma or GED.

Once you can get into a training program, the objective should be to learn a great deal of the fundamentals while putting what you've learned into practice through hands-on training sessions.

Lastly, graduates of an electrician training program may proceed to seek licensing and certification with the state board. We provide more details about this in one of the upcoming sections, but first, here's a quick look at some of the very best electrician schools in the state.
