## **How to Become an Electrician in Georgia**

Below is an optimal path to begin a career as an electrician in Georgia.

**Make sure you qualify for training.**

The critical step in any journey to becoming an electrician in Georgia is obtaining training from an appropriate institution. But before candidates can even get to this point, they must ensure they have the requirements to secure admission into a program. This involves having at least a high school diploma or GED and being 16 years old.

**Choose your training route.**

To become an electrician in Georgia, you must fulfill classroom and supervised work experience requirements. Below are the locations where you can receive such training.

**Formal academic programs**

Applying for an electrical technology program will help aspiring electricians in Georgia gain a certificate or even a degree. This will also help them fulfill the classroom requirements to secure a license once they complete their training.

One of the benefits of attending a formal academic program is that the certificate or degree obtained here goes a long way in seeing candidates apart and helping them secure employment.

That said, while most formal academic programs try to teach students as many practical aspects of the job as possible, it is advisable to complement such programs with additional on-the-job training programs to fulfill the work experience requirements.

**Apprenticeship programs**

Apprenticeship training programs for future electricians in Georgia are the best way to receive on-the-job training and hands-on instructions while fulfilling the work experience requirement needed for licensure at the same time.

There are several apprenticeship programs for electricians in Georgia organized by trade unions and other trade associations.

Of course, other apprenticeship programs are organized by companies, schools, or other non-union organizations.
