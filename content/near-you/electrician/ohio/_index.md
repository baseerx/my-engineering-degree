## **How to Become an Electrician in Ohio**

An aspiring electrician in Ohio may follow the steps below to kick-start their career.

**Step 1: Basic Requirements**

Aspiring electricians in Ohio may start training at 16, but by the time they apply to become licensed contractors, they must be at least 18. A high school diploma or GED will also make the entire step much more straightforward.

**Step 2: Vocational schools**

Aspiring electricians in Ohio may enroll in a college program or a vocational School for their actual electrical technology training. Here, they will become familiar with critical topics such as electrical components, residential and commercial electrical wiring, blueprint reading, shop mathematics, and safety.

Training programs for electricians in Ohio can be completed in a few months. However, they may include more advanced topics, in which program completion time may be up to four years. Those who prefer a fast-track approach should enroll in certificate programs.

Among the topics, students will learn algebra, electrical components, national electrical code, and state codes and regulations.

**Step 3: Apprenticeships**

Aspiring electricians in Ohio may enroll in apprenticeship programs to supplement their vocational school training. These programs focus heavily on hands-on training, which means that candidates can get a lot of real-world experience to contribute to their resume and leverage to qualify for licensure.

Of course, aspiring electricians can enroll in apprenticeship programs without even worrying about formal academic programs. Even though apprenticeship programs focus on hands-on training, they include classroom topics such as electricity, electrical wiring, and health and safety.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

The board in charge of overseeing statewide certification and licensing for electricians in Ohio is the State of Ohio Department of Commerce, [Ohio Construction Industry Licensing Board](https://com.ohio.gov/divisions-and-programs/industrial-compliance/boards/ohio-construction-industry-licensing-board).

Currently, the board does not expect electricians to be licensed before they can secure employment. Non-licensed electricians can work under the supervision of licensed electricians. Middletown and Hamilton are the only cities that wish licensure upon graduation from a training program.

Candidates wishing to become licensed contractors in the state must have been employed for five years and be at least 18 years old when they apply for their license. They should also be prepared to pass a background check and the electrical trade examination.
