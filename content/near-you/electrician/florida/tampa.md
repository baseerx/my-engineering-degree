## **How to Become an Electrician in Tampa**

An essential step in becoming an electrician in Tampa is acquiring proper education from a vocational school or an apprenticeship program. Both of these pathways are viable for obtaining a state license eventually.

Usually, apprenticeship and formal training programs ask candidates to be at least 18 years old and possess a high school diploma or GED before applying.

To obtain a license in Tampa, an electrician must have acquired 8000 hours of electrical experience through a training program. Those who fulfill these requirements will then officially take the journeyman certification exams to secure employment. After working for two years, they can sit for the master electrician examination.
