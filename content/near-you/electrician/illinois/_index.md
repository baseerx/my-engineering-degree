## **How to Become an Electrician in Illinois**

To become an electrician in Illinois, you must graduate from a training program. Luckily, this doesn't necessarily have to be an institutional program run by a college or trade school. It is also possible to graduate from an apprenticeship program.

Of course, either is fine, but those looking for an easier path toward getting a job may consider obtaining a degree before seeking employment.

**Basic Requirements**

Enrolling in a training program — be it an apprenticeship or an institutional one — is usually advisable to have your high school diploma or GED ready. Candidates must also be at least 17 to apply for most of these programs.

**Vocational Schools vs Apprenticeships**

Vocational schools and college-run electrician training programs create technically sound electricians with a strong foundation in theoretical principles. Most of these programs also encourage students to acquire hands-on training and real-world experience by working with companies as interns before graduation.

Apprenticeship programs allow aspiring electricians to work with established master electricians in real-world workshops and external locations. Some apprenticeship programs also help with job placement after the programs are done.

Most apprenticeships take 4 or 5 years to complete.
