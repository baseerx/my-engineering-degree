## **How to Become an Electrician in New York**

A good thing about becoming an electrician in New York is that you don't necessarily have a college degree to get started. Some people do, of course, but not everyone has to.

Alternatively, you may attend a vocational school with an impressive certificate program. Additionally, you may skip formal programs entirely and simply enroll in an apprenticeship training program. And, of course, you may do both and enjoy the best of both worlds.

A common approach is to spend time in a trade school and then spend a little more time in an apprenticeship to gain the necessary real-world exposure. It is also worth mentioning that those who do this spend less time in the apprenticeship program than those who go straight into apprenticeship programs without attending a trade school.
