## **How to Become an Electrician in Pennsylvania**

**Basic Prerequisites**

The basic prerequisites for becoming an electrician in Pennsylvania are simple. First, you must be at least 17 years old to be accepted in most training programs. Secondly, these programs ask for proof of high school graduation via a high school diploma or GED equivalent.

**Training Programs**

Future electricians in Pennsylvania must enroll in a training program. This can either be an on-the-job program or a formal institutional program.

**On the job Programs**

On-the-job programs seek to train future electricians while they are practicing. For this reason, they usually involve a lot of hands-on training.

Some on-the-job training programs may also incorporate elements of classroom training to bring up students on the theoretical aspects of the job.

Examples of on-the-job training programs are apprenticeship programs run by unions and approved companies. It is also acceptable to work as an electrician assistant under the supervision of licensed electricians.

**Institutional Programs**

Electricians who wish to earn a certificate or an associate degree before they seek employment may consider enrolling in institutional programs instead.

Community colleges and vocational schools offer several of these programs in Pennsylvania. We take a look at some of these below.

## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

All electricians in Pennsylvania are expected to obtain a license before they can secure employment, take on contracts and work on electrical projects.

But unlike most other states, licensing for electricians in Pennsylvania is not done by the state but by each of the municipalities. Usually, however, most of them follow the same approach â€” aspiring electricians must first enter into an apprenticeship program, attend a trade school or work under the direct supervision of a licensed electrician, as highlighted above.

From there, most municipalities require that candidates pass an exam organized by the [International Code Council (ICC)](https://www.iccsafe.org/) in that particular county or city.
