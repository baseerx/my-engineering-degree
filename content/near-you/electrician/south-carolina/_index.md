## **How to Become an Electrician in South Carolina**

Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the required process to become an electrician in South Carolina.

**Step 1: Meeting the Basic Requirements**

The first step to becoming an electrician in South Carolina is to meet the basic requirements. Thankfully, these are simple: you must be at least 18 years old, have a high school diploma or GED, and have a basic understanding of mathematics and physics.

**Step 2: Choose a Training Arrangement.**

Candidates may consider any of three training arrangements for their actual training.

* ***Academic Programs -*** Fresh electricians in South Carolina starting their careers tend to seek academic training at a trade school or community college. Here, they'll earn a certificate or associate degree, depending on how long they spend in school.

This will also go a long way in helping them stand out when it's time to secure employment.

* ***Apprenticeship Programs***—Attending an apprenticeship program is the most popular approach to becoming an electrician in South Carolina. These programs are usually consistent in their approach, offering predominantly hands-on training with little classroom instruction.
* ***Carpenter’s Assistant***—Candidates can also learn on the job by working as a carpenter's assistant until they are ready to branch out independently. This arrangement is particularly suitable for candidates who have completed a fast-tracked academic program and are willing to consolidate their training with more hands-on training.

**Step 3: Specialize, Stand Out, & Secure Employment**

Lastly, after their general training, candidates may choose an area of specialization to narrow their options and give themselves better career opportunities. As we highlight further below, professional credentials may also help greatly in this regard.

From there, they may fulfill the certification and licensing requirements below to kickstart their careers.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

South Carolina is one of the states that has mandatory certification and licensing requirements for candidates.

While the [South Carolina Department of Licensing and Regulation](https://llr.sc.gov/) is responsible for issuing a state license to fresh electricians, the [Municipal Association of South Carolina](https://www.masc.sc/) issues certifications needed to obtain professional licenses.

To qualify for these, candidates must obtain academic and hands-on training. They must then earn a journeyman electrician license and pass the appropriate examination.

After working as a certified and licensed journeyman electrician in the state for 4 years, candidates may take the master electrician examination.
