To begin becoming an electrician in Indiana, there are a few things to consider. Firstly, you must choose between different educational categories and then decide on a specific program within your desired category.

Then you must fulfill some requirements to get certified and properly licensed in the state. Of course, you may also have to meet a few requirements before you can get into a training program in the first place.

If all of this sound overwhelming, rest assured they are not. Once you get familiar with the process, it all becomes infinitely easier. To that end, below is an in-depth guide containing everything you need to know about becoming an electrician in Indiana so that the entire process becomes easier.

## **How to Become an Electrician in Indiana**

Indiana, like most states in the country, encourages its electricians to be as educated as possible. They do this through a series of requirements and licensing prerequisites.

Firstly, to become an electrician in Indiana you must be properly trained at an accredited school or apprenticeship program. The schools, in turn, usually ask that applicants possess a high school diploma or GED.

Experience on the job also counts a lot regarding getting certified and licensed. So aspiring electricians usually find a way to acquire this while they are still engaged in the training process or afterwards.

From there, graduates may apply for and pass the licensing tests, after which they may finally consider themselves professional electricians.

## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

Just as it is in most states, electricians in Indiana are required by law to get licensed before they can start taking on contracts legally. But unlike some other states, electricians in Indiana have to get licensed by their local municipalities instead of state bodies.

To do this, they must sit for and pass the residential or journeyman electrician electrical exam. To qualify for the exam, applicants must complete an official application, turn in an employer letter detailing six years of electrical trade experience, and also provide three customer reference letters.

Journeyman electricians may then proceed to earn a master electrician license after a year more years of experience.
