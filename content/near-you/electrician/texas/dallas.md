## **How to Become an Electrician in Dallas**

To start practicing as a professional electrician in Dallas, candidates must have graduated from an electrician training program. In this regard, there are usually two options.

The first is to enroll in a formal training program organized by a trade school/college, while the second option is to apply for an apprenticeship program organized by unions or other approved entities.

After completing a training program, the next step is to apply for a license with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. This step involves a $20 registration fee.

Candidates must then sit for their journeyman electrician license. After working for two years, a journeyman electrician can move on to apply for a master electrician license.
