A career as a plumber in the District of Columbia offers the opportunity to work in a flexible, scalable, and highly rewarding field. Getting started as a professional in the area is straightforward, with minimal requirements.

The most important of all the basic requirements is obtaining proper training and education. And even for this, numerous high-quality programs make the process incredibly smooth and exciting.

Below we look at some of the most notable plumber training schools in and around DC, providing a few notes on their unique attributes and what makes them worthy of consideration.

## **How to Become a Plumber in Washington**

Since no law mandates a primary college education for plumbers in DC, individuals who wish to become plumbers in Washington may choose to obtain their training directly on the job. This is possible thanks to many apprenticeship programs in and around the city.

Of course, just because there is no postsecondary requirement doesn't mean that individuals who desire formal education cannot apply for one. Both options are acceptable, and your chosen path is ultimately up to you.

The next step is obtaining a license once formal training or apprenticeship is complete. Plumbers in Washington start by becoming journeyman plumbers, after which they may apply for a license as master plumbers.

Plumbers who wish to take on more significant contracts must apply for a Plumbing Contractor license. To become a plumbing contractor, you must have obtained a master plumber license or employ at least one individual who possesses such a license.

## **Top Plumbing Technician Schools in Washington, DC**

Without further ado, here are some of the best plumbing technician schools in and around Washington, DC.

### **1\. Department of Employment Services**

Department of Employment Services (DOES) offers plumbing apprenticeships for aspiring plumbers nationwide. The program is an initiative of the government, and it aims to produce competent professionals by mixing rigorous classroom study with hands-on training sessions instructed by seasoned professionals.
