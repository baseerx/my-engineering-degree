For a plumber in New York City to carry out their duties of troubleshooting, installing, upgrading, repairing, and recommending an array of plumbing systems and components, they need to have a very sound knowledge of all types of plumbing systems in the first place.

They must obtain training in one form or the other to acquire this knowledge. And what is even more critical than securing an internship is getting training from the right programs and institutions.

To that end, we have provided a detailed yet concise list of some of the most notable plumbing schools in and around New York cities with incredible courses, facilities, and instructors.

## **How to Become a Plumber in New York City**

As an aspiring plumber in New York City, the first thing that should be on your mind is enrolling in a training program. In this regard, you could enroll in an apprenticeship program or a formal training program at a college or trade school.

Once you're done with training, the next thing to concern yourself is licensing.

New York is one of the states where plumbers are not expected to get a license on a statewide level. Instead, they are to consult their different City/ municipality departments.

For aspiring plumbers in New York City, the City Department of Buildings (DOB) handles the licensing specifications and examinations for plumbers in the city.
