Proficiency in reading and writing the English language and being physically fit is also mandatory.

**Step 2: Obtaining Training**

When it comes to obtaining training for future plumbers in New York, there are usually three different approaches: enrolling in a formal training program, enrolling in an apprenticeship program, and learning as a plumber's apprentice.

* **Formal Training Program** - New York is home to many beautiful colleges and technical schools offering various plumbing programs, all hoping to produce sound plumbers with enough experience to begin entry-level duties.
* **Apprenticeship Program** - New York also boasts many excellent apprenticeship training programs for plumbers. Most of these programs are run by trade unions and organizations. They allow students to train under the tutelage and mentorship of experienced plumbers.
* **Plumber's Assistants** - it is also possible to become a plumber in New York by working directly under a licensed plumber as a plumber's assistant. Doing this for a few years usually equates to achieving the technical know-how and work experience required for individual projects.

Individuals who want a more robust form of training can achieve this goal by combining two or more options above. For example, many plumbers in the state have been known to complete a training program and then acquire more hands-on experience by working as assistants or apprentices.
