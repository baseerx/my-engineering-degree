## **How to Become a Plumber in Virginia**

Below are the steps required to start a plumbing career in Virginia.

**Step 1 Basic Requirements**

The basic requirement to become a plumber in Virginia is simple â€” be at least 18 years old. From here, candidates may move on to the next step, acquiring classroom and real-world training from approved training programs.

**Step 2A: Academic Program**

Plumbers in Virginia often begin their careers by attending a community college, trade school, or technical institute. This is the academic route, and it offers several advantages.

Even though it is possible to obtain a level of classroom instruction and hands-on training from both academic and apprenticeship programs, it is common for candidates to combine both approaches for the most comprehensive results.

**Step 3: Certification**

Lastly, even though it is not compulsory, plumbers in Virginia may seek professional certification to enjoy professional benefits. They may do this before or after licensure. We discuss more on the topic below.
