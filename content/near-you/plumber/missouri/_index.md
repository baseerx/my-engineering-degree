## **How to Become a Plumber in Missouri**

Aspiring plumbers in Missouri must fulfill the considerations below to launch their careers.

**Age Requirements**

Prospective plumbers in Missouri must attain a certain age before practicing. However, the specific figure tends to vary from one municipality to another.

While some places require plumbers to be at least 18 years old to obtain a journeyman license, others expect candidates to be no younger than 21. In some places, individuals must be at least 25 to qualify for a master's license.

**Basic Educational Requirements**

Apart from meeting a specific age, aspiring plumbers in Missouri are also expected to be academically sound. They must have at least a high school diploma or GED. It is also a great advantage if they possess a solid understanding of some foundational topics in mathematics and geometry.

**Plumbing Training**

After all the requirements above are met, candidates may select a training program. In this regard, there are two main options: the academic route and the apprenticeship route.

The academic route involves attending a community college or technical school. Here, candidates may train for a period ranging between 6 months at the earliest and 4 years in some cases. They will also graduate with valuable degrees and certificates.

Those who wish to go through the apprenticeship route will enjoy thorough hands-on training and mentorship opportunities. They may also be able to earn some income while they're still learning the trade.

**Earning Certification**

While certification is not mandatory for plumbers in Missouri, earning one has benefits. Among other things, it helps candidates stand out for employment, and it helps them improve through continuing education.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

Missouri has no statewide licensing mandate for plumbers. However, some municipalities ask for certain conditions to be met before a license can be issued.

An example of this is St. Louis. Here, candidates must provide documentation and pay a $30 fee to the St. Louis Department of Public Works Central Office in Clayton to qualify for a license.

In Kansas City, candidates must also pass an examination and apply to the [City Planning & Development - Development Services](https://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/departments/city-planning-development). Candidates who successfully pass their examinations can call themselves a licensed journeyman plumber.

After 4 years of work experience as a journeyman plumber, candidates may apply for a master plumber license before applying for an independent contractor license.

## **Salary & Career Outlook**

A survey of plumbers in the state revealed that the annual average salary of a regular plumber in Missouri is around $58,785. Those among the top 10% take home an annual average salary of $106,150, while those among the bottom 10% take home an annual average salary of $32,555.

Experience, specialty, location, and establishment of employment play key roles in determining where a plumber will fall along these lines. For instance, while plumbers in the state with less than a year of experience make around $49,248 on average, those with more than 10 years of experience earn an average salary of $71,447 annually.
