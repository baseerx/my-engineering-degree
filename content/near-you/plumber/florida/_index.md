Plumbers in Florida – as anywhere else – are responsible for installing, upgrading, fixing, and maintaining crucial water systems without which our lives would be less convenient than it is.

Along with understanding how to fabricate and install these systems, plumbers must also be familiar with safety measures to keep us safe. For all of these reasons, plumbers in Florida are expected to undergo significant training before they can start working in the state.

They are also required to fulfill a handful of other requirements, which we take an in-depth look at in the following sections.

For aspiring plumbers in the state, we also examine a few notable training programs to consider for the best education.

## **How to Become a Plumber in Florida**

In Florida, aspiring plumbers must receive a proper education before working. They usually have to go through an apprenticeship or a college/vocational school to obtain this education.

Before all of these, however, they must meet some basic requirements, including having a GED or high school diploma and a strong foundation in subjects like Science, Technology, Mathematics, and Computers.

**Training Programs**

Plumbers in Florida may choose to obtain their training from formal training programs. These programs are offered by vocational schools and colleges all across the state.

Among other things, students enjoy training under experienced instructors who are sound in both theoretical principles and practical applications.

Enrolling in accredited institutions with high-quality programs and a reputation for producing successful candidates is essential. Later in the upcoming sections, we will look at some of these programs.

**Apprenticeship Programs**

Going through an apprenticeship program is another viable route to becoming a plumber in Florida. One of the appeals of apprenticeships is that they focus strictly on hands-on training and acquiring real-world experience even before the plumbers-in-training graduate.

This is not to say that some apprenticeship programs don't incorporate some classroom training, as they sometimes do.

**Plumber's Assistants**

Lastly, aspiring plumbers in Florida May do away with both options above and instead, directly work as assistants to licensed plumbers.

By doing so, they can acquire the knowledge they need to perform their duties while also racking up work experience in the *real world.*

## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

The state of Florida expects all plumbing contractors to be licensed before they can start taking on contracts. It is also possible to legally perform plumbing work in the state by being an apprentice working under a licensed contractor.

Generally, the state has two types of plumbing licenses — the Certified Plumbing Contractor license and the Registered Plumbing Contractor license.

While the State Certified Plumbing Contractor license allows plumbers to work anywhere in the state, the State Registered license only will enable them to work in specific localities.

The State Certified license requires candidates to pass the state licensing exam, while the Registered license requires only a local competency exam.
