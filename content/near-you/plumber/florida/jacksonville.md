Future plumbers in Jacksonville, Florida, will be glad to know that the city boasts many incredible plumbing training programs. They'll also be happy to know that these options are not limited to technical schools alone but also community colleges and even union-run programs.

As you'll see below, however, the training direction you choose as an aspiring plumber in Jacksonville is all down to you, and there is no wrong option.

Ultimately, what matters is that you acquire high-level training from a proper institution with a sound program and a history of producing successful professionals in the field.

To that end, we have provided below a comprehensive list containing some of the most prominent programs in and around Jacksonville, Florida, that fulfill these requirements and will help you achieve your goals.

## **How to Become a Plumber in Jacksonville**

As with most skilled trades in the state, plumbers in Jacksonville start their careers by enrolling in a training program. They must provide copies of their high school diploma or GED to do this. Once they graduate, they must obtain a license from the state board.

The Board has two different licenses for plumbers: the Certified Plumbing Contractor license and the Registered Plumbing Contractor license.

The former is enough to work anywhere in the state, while the latter only qualifies plumbers to work in certain localities. Plumbers in Jacksonville may also choose to get certified to improve their career opportunities.

### **1\. Florida State College**

Florida State College in Jacksonville remains one of the premier destinations for high-quality plumbing education in the city and across the state. Students will acquire training for 12 months, including 145 hours of instruction.

The program is flexible, and courses are selected based on particular careers. Generally, however, students will learn waste services, water systems, building plans, hot water distribution, plumbing history, and even basic mathematics.

To be admitted, candidates must have a high school diploma and GED. Those who graduate successfully can apply for the state licensing exam.

The program is known to have a very affordable tuition cost, which usually falls slightly above $2000 (including tuition and instructional materials such as books and plumbing tools).

The Jacksonville Plumbers and Pipefitters Joint Apprenticeship and Training Trust offers one of the most comprehensive training programs for aspiring plumbers in Jacksonville. In an apprenticeship program, students can look forward to rigorous hands-on training with professional supervision.

Still, it also includes a great deal of administrative topics such as plumbing business administration, communications, and of course, safety and regulation.

Students will have to study for three terms, lasting about 63 weeks.

### 4\. Miami Lakes Educational Center & Technical College
