## **How to Become a Plumber in Georgia**

Since no particular education program is considered the only suitable option, candidates looking to become plumbers in Georgia may choose the program that suits them best.

**Choosing a Training Program**

Usually, there are three options to consider when choosing a plumbing training program, including the following:

**Academic programs**

Academic programs provide in-depth classroom training for future plumbers and provisions for hands-on instruction. Such programs – typically offered by community colleges and vocational schools – also come with either a certificate or a degree that may be leveraged to secure employment at top establishments or even pursue more advanced areas of specialization.

The duration of a plumbing academic program tends to differ depending on a few factors, including the institution and type of degree in sight. Below, we look at some of the most notable academic programs for future plumbers in Georgia.

**Apprenticeships**

Trade unions and other approved parties organize apprenticeship programs. Students acquire secondary experience and the skills they'll need to start a successful career through these arrangements.

Most apprenticeships can be completed in four years.

**Plumber's Assistant**

It is also possible to obtain the skills and work experience required to become a plumber in Georgia by simply working as an assistant to a master plumber in the state.

**Basic Requirements**

It is worth considering that aspiring plumbers in Georgia must have a high school diploma or GED before enrolling in a training program. Solid foundations in a few mathematics and related areas are also necessary.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

The board responsible for licensing plumbers in Georgia is the Licensing Division of the Georgia Secretary of State's Office, particularly the Division of Master and Journeyman Plumbers.

Candidates will need a journeyman license to perform plumbing work in the state. After two years of working as a journeyman plumber, they can apply to be a master plumber by obtaining a license.

The master license is divided into two types:

* The Master License Class 1 Restricted, and
* The Master License Class 2 Unrestricted.

A Class 1 license restricts plumbers in the state to single-family buildings and commercial structures that don't exceed 10,000 sq ft. A class 2 license has no restrictions.
