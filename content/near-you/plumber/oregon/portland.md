Anyone who's ever had to fix their plumbing systems without help has probably realized from experience how essential plumbers are in our society. Understanding the complex system that provides us running water and efficient channels to dispose of our waste is not an ability that comes out of thin air.

It takes significant training and education to become familiar enough with these systems to manipulate them to suit specific scenarios.

Thankfully, several colleges and vocational institutions are qualified to provide this training. The only challenge is identifying the best one.

The list below is a great way to start for anyone looking to become a plumber in Portland and wondering which school is the best alternative.

## **Accredited Plumbing Programs**

Plumbers in Portland and other areas in Oregon must be licensed before they can practice. Licensing is required on every level, including journeymen, master plumbers, and plumbing contractors.

An essential licensing requirement in the state is to obtain training from an accredited program/institution. For this reason, regardless of whether you're getting your exercise from an apprenticeship program or a classroom, you must confirm that your training source is accredited.

Naturally, we have ensured that all the entries below are accredited and offer a direct path toward getting licensed.
