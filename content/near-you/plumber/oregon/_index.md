## **How to Become a Plumber in Oregon**

To become a plumber in Oregon, you must follow a handful of general steps and some state-mandated ones. Below is a quick outline of the most popular paths employed by plumbers in states.

**Enrolling in a Training Program**

There is no one way to become a plumber, but a structured way is to enroll in a plumbing school and obtain a formal certificate. There are many benefits to this approach.

It provides a solid technical foundation and helps you prepare for the licensing exam, which often requires a significant amount of structured studying.

While formal classroom training is optional for most plumbers, anyone looking to become a medical gas piping installer is required by law to obtain formal education from an accredited program.

**Plumbing Training Schools in Oregon**

Oregon boasts of some impressive training schools for aspiring plumbers in the state. These include:

* Lane Community College
* Chemeketa Community College
* Clackamas Community College
* Portland Community College

These programs require candidates to be at least 18 and possess a GED or high school diploma. They must also have passed an algebra class with a C or higher.

**Completing an Apprenticeship**

It is famous for people to become plumbers by simply walking onto a site or an office and requesting an apprenticeship opportunity. One of the key benefits of this approach is that it provides much-needed experience on the job. Another is that earning on the job as an apprentice is possible.

Those who obtain their training from a formal classroom environment may also choose to complete apprenticeship programs.

**Apprenticeship Requirements in Oregon**

Most apprenticeship programs require applicants to be 18 or older and have completed high school or a GED. Ensuring that apprenticeship training is obtained from an approved and licensed plumber is also crucial.

## **Licensing For Plumbers In Oregon**

Any aspiring plumber in Oregon must comply with a handful of specifications laid down by the **Oregon Construction Contractors Board (CCB)**. One such specification exists to determine who qualifies for a journeyman license.

The requirements differ depending on the channel through which you obtained your training. Those who got trained through an apprenticeship program must provide the following:

* A certificate to show completion of 4 years of apprenticeship training. A referral from a registered activity committed can also suffice.

Those who obtained their training from a classroom must provide the following:

* Verified proof of 576 hours of classroom training and 3,850 hours of activity on the job.

**Licensing Exam in Oregon**

Fulfilling the above requirements qualifies a budding plumber to sit for the journeyman licensing exam. Applicants must pay $100 to apply.

The CCB offers a handful of locations to make the exam more convenient. These include Bend, Hermiston, Ontario, Pendleton, Portland, Roseburg, Eugene, Klamath Falls, Salem, Lincoln City, and White City.

**Continuing Education**

One of the best parts of obtaining a license is that it must also be maintained and renewed. In Oregon and most states, continuing education is a crucial part of license renewal.

Continuing education helps professionals keep up with the changing landscape of their jobs, including technological advances, conventions, safety guides, and ethics.
