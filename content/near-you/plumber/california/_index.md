Plumbers are professionals with extensive knowledge of how to repair and maintain components of water supply systems and critical heating/sanitation units. They are usually trained to be capable of working in several sectors, including both residential and commercial environments.

In California, plumbers have to go through a handful of general and state-specific steps before being allowed to practice professionally.

Below, we look at all of these steps and their requirements. We also look at some of the most notable training programs for aspiring plumbers in the state to consider, along with potential salary projections once employment is secured.

## **How to Become a Plumber in California**

**Basic Requirements**

The state of California has some requirements for its plumbers, which include the fact that they must be at least 18 years of age and have a social security number or a taxpayer identification number.

The state also has some licensing requirements that we will discuss below.

Additionally, training programs require a high school diploma or GED.

**Training Programs**

Training programs represent the most crucial step in becoming a plumber. This is where aspiring plumbers will learn everything they need to carry out their duties on the job, including how to work with specific tools and even handle the business side of the profession.

In this regard, individuals usually choose between a formal training program or an apprenticeship program.

**Formal Training Programs**

Formal training at a vocational school is not mandatory for a plumber in California. Many choose this training because it offers a pervasive form of education.

At formal training programs, students get to learn about the theoretical aspects of the job while also having the opportunity to practice what they've learned in laboratories and sometimes even real-world scenarios through internship and workshop sessions.

**Apprenticeship Training**

California allows aspiring plumbers to get their education through an apprenticeship by completing a few years of training "on the job." This is usually done under the supervision of licensed plumbers.

The number of hours required to graduate from an apprenticeship program differs based on the particular apprenticeship. Some can take five years, while others can be completed in just two years.

Apprenticeship programs teach specialized skills and crucial plumbing procedures, codes, and regulations.

## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

To become licensed as a journeyman plumber in California, applicants must have 2 to 3 years of experience in a training program or two years of training as an apprentice plumber.

Either of these requirements qualifies candidates to sit for the journeyman licensing exam.

Journeyman plumbers in California who wish to obtain their master plumbers license must have accrued additional two years of work experience as a journeyman plumber. They must then sit for another licensing exam, which is usually significantly more complex than the previous one.

Both journeyman and master plumbers in California must have a C-36 Plumbing Contractors License, awarded by the State Department of Consumer Affairs.

## **Salary and Job Outlook**

A plumber in California can expect to earn an annual average salary of $58,982, the same as the national average. If factors like experience, location, and establishment type are optimized, a plumber in California can earn as high as $95,305.

Those on the lower end of these conditions still earn an annual average salary of $36,503.

Rancho Cucamonga and Fullerton are the top two highest-paying cities for plumbers in California, with annual average salaries of $119,258 and $114,253. Pasadena, Simi Valley, and San Jose complete the top five with average yearly salaries of $112,113, $77,636, and $69,877, respectively.
