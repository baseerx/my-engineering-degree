## **How to Become a Plumber in New Mexico**

Aspiring plumbers in New Mexico must follow the following steps before they can begin their careers:

**High School Diploma or GED**

Completing a secondary education is vital to enroll in vocational training for plumbers. Even certification and licensing usually require a high school diploma or GED.

Additionally, vocational courses in high school, along with mathematics, science, and technology subjects, usually provide a strong foundation for future plumbers.

**Plumbing Training Alternatives**

A high school diploma qualifies you to enroll in plumbing training. But when obtaining the training required to become a plumber, there are a few alternatives to consider.

We take a look at all the available options below.

* **Vocational/Trade School** - There are numerous accredited technical universities in New Mexico where students can learn how to become successful plumbers. These programs often have a certificate option and an associate degree option to give graduates a bigger chance of securing employment at respectable institutions.

* **Fast-Tracked Courses** & **Plumbing Assistance -** Fast-tracked courses offer a faster path toward becoming a plumber. They usually last for about ten weeks and deal with general plumbing techniques.

To consolidate the knowledge acquired at a fast-tracked program, working for a while as a plumber's assistant is advisable.

## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

The state of New Mexico has strict licensure requirements for apprentice plumbers and journeyman plumbers. The New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Department issues licenses in both categories.

Candidates must be at least 18 and have a high school diploma and driver's license to be eligible for the apprentice license. They must have completed a training program or apprenticeship and take an online exam to become a journeyman plumber in the state.

Unlike most other states, New Mexico does not have a master plumber license category. Anyone who wishes to transcend the journeyman description may move on to become a plumbing contractor. They may apply for the plumbing contractor license issued by the Construction Industries and Manufactured Housing Division.
