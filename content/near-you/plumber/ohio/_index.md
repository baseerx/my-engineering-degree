## **How to Become a Plumber in Ohio**

The following are the steps to become a plumber in Ohio.

**Fundamental Educational Requirements**

The first step in becoming a plumber in Ohio is to meet the fundamental educational requirements. For instance, most training programs will ask that individuals be 18 years old and have a high school diploma or GED.

You may also complete a certificate course through trade schools or plumbing apprenticeships, the second and most crucial step.

**Skills Acquisition**

Certificate courses offered by trade schools are enough to acquire an array of plumbing skills and start a plumbing career in Ohio. If you want to specialize in medical gas piping installation, you may have to go through additional training programs that have achieved state approval.

Generally, however, simply attending a trade or apprenticeship program should give you enough classroom instructions and hands-on training to start your career.

**Internships & Real-World Learning**

Plumbers may obtain additional real-world experience by participating in internship programs. Commonly, trade programs and community colleges might have an agreement with local workshops and commercial installations to allow students to receive such hands-on training.

On the other hand, apprenticeships are usually conducive to real-world experience by design.

**License & Continuing Education**

After completing the training program, the next step for an aspiring plumber in Ohio is to become licensed and consider certification. They may then receive continuing education as specified by the employer or personal preference.

**Consider trades with similar paths:**

## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

Plumbers in Ohio are expected to get licensed by the Ohio Construction Industry Licensing Board. It is possible to start working as an apprentice under a licensed plumber before acquiring your license.

The state only has one kind of plumber license, which is the Commercial Contractor License. To acquire this license, candidates must be at least 18 years old and be citizens of the United States.

Those who are considered legal aliens may also apply.

Once they get board approval, the next step is to complete a state and federal background check.

They must then pass the trade examination and pay the applicable fees to receive their license officially.
