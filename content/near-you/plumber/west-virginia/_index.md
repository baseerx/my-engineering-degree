## **How to Become a Plumber in West Virginia**

**Step 1: High School Diploma or GED**

Apart from being required to enroll in training programs and apprenticeships, a high school diploma or GED prepares future plumbers for the challenges they'll face.

Subjects such as mathematics, science, and computer science are all useful during a plumbing career.

**Step 2: Training Programs**

Training programs for plumbers can be divided into three broad categories - trade school/college programs, apprenticeship programs, and fast-tracked programs.

**Trade Schools**

Even though no law mandates a university education, many plumbers in West Virginia usually consider obtaining one anyway to have a solid theoretical foundation to build their careers upon.

They also get to graduate with a certificate or associate degree that gives them an edge when it's time to apply for jobs.

**Apprenticeship**

Apprenticeship programs provide immediate real-world experience and mentorship for interested candidates. It is also possible for an apprenticeship program to incorporate some classroom training in addition to its hands-on sessions.

**Fast-Tracked Plumbing Course**

Fast-tracked plumbing programs take between 8 to 10 weeks to complete. For this reason, they are usually an attractive alternative for aspiring plumbers looking to get started as fast as possible.

**Step 3: Work Experience**

To start working and obtain a license, work experience is an essential factor. Vocational and college programs typically find a way to incorporate this aspect into their coursework. In contrast, apprenticeship programs last a couple of years, during which real-world experience is the main objective.

Those who attend a fast-tracked program may fulfill this requirement by working as a plumber's assistant.

## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

West Virginia plumbers must be licensed before they can perform plumbing work. The available licensing categories include apprentice, journeyman, master, and contractor.

Candidates start as apprentices through the "Plumber in Training" license by being at least 18 years old and working under the supervision of a licensed plumber. They tend to become "Journeyman Plumbers" by completing the training program and passing the written licensing exam with a score of at least 70%.

Master plumbers have acquired more than a year of experience as Journeyman Plumbers. Lastly, master plumbers can become Plumbing Contractors by applying for a Contractor License from the West Virginia Division of Labor.
