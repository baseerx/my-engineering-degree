## **How to Become a Plumber in Charleston**

Aspiring plumbers in Charleston, West Virginia, usually start by acquiring a high school diploma or GED, which they'll need to enroll in a college program or a trade school. Those who desire a more hands-on approach may choose an apprenticeship program instead.

It is also possible to consider a fast-tracked training program lasting for a few months instead of the years-long route. Graduates of fast-tracked courses may have to complement their training with a few months of work as a plumber's assistant to acquire real-world experience.

As for licensure, plumbers in Charleston must start as "Plumber in Training" before applying for a Journeyman license. Those who wish to take on more significant contracts must apply for a Plumbing Contractor License but must have already been practicing as a Master Plumber.
