Plumbing is one of the most in-demand professions today, with an optimistic projection for the coming decade. Anyone in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with a knack for working with tools and breaking down components to fix and upgrade them would consider a career in the field.

Below we look at some avenues through which interested individuals in Pennsylvania can acquire the necessary training to enjoy a successful career as a plumber.

## **How to Become a Plumber in Philadelphia**

In Pennsylvania, becoming a plumber starts with having a high school diploma or GED. Either of these credentials will be needed to secure admission into a training program or an apprenticeship program.

This will also be needed to secure licensing down the road.

Licensing for plumbers in Pennsylvania, as with most skilled trades in the state, is done on a county/municipality level. This means aspiring plumbers in Philadelphia can pursue something other than a statewide license but instead, consult the Philadelphia plumbing board.

Usually, graduation from a training program or experience accrued during an apprenticeship/on-the-job training is enough to satisfy the licensure examinations.
