## **How to Become a Plumber in Pennsylvania**

Aspiring plumbers in Pennsylvania can begin their careers by obtaining training through one of the following avenues:

**Formal Training Programs**

A "formal" plumbing training program is any official program offered by several institutions, including colleges, community colleges, technical schools, vocational schools, and trade schools.

These programs usually incorporate many classroom and workshop training for hands-on practice.

**Apprenticeship Program**

Plumbing organizations and trade unions offer apprenticeship programs, and all aim to produce new batches of plumbers who are technically sound and familiar with the fundamental principles of safety regulations.

Most plumbing apprenticeships last between 3 to 5 years.

**Plumber's Assistant**

Aspiring plumbers in Pennsylvania who want to avoid going through the options above may learn under a plumber by working as an assistant for a few years before branching out independently.

The work experience obtained during this time will be enough to acquire a license and start taking on contracts independently.

**Professional Experience**

Many states, including Pennsylvania, specify work experience as a licensing prerequisite. Usually, time spent in training and apprenticeship programs or working as a plumber's assistant contributes to the work experience requirement.

It is advisable to combine two or more of the training options above, for instance, completing a training program and then working as an apprenticeship; or completing an apprenticeship and then working as a plumber's assistant for a while.
