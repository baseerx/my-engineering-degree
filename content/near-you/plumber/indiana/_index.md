## **How to Become a Plumber in Indiana**

The following are the key steps a candidate must pass through to become a plumber in Indiana.

**Basic Requirements**

As an aspiring plumber in Indiana, you first want to put yourself in a position to meet the licensing requirements. Currently, the most basic requirements require candidates to be at least 17 years old and be enrolled in a recognized training program.

Most training programs also require a high school diploma or GED.

**Plumbing Training (Classroom)**

The rules in Indiana state that individuals must complete both classroom and on-the-job training before becoming professional plumbers. For the classroom aspect of their training, students may enroll in a community college/trade school â€” some of which we highlight in an upcoming section below.

These schools offer rigorous training in foundational principles. Even though candidates must participate in real-world training, some academic programs also arrange such training.

**Plumbing Training (On the Job)**

Along with classroom training, an aspiring plumber in Indiana is also expected to receive training on the job. Usually, most candidates obtain this training by participating in an apprenticeship program.

Of course, such an apprenticeship program must be approved by the state commission to be valid. Some apprenticeship programs also offer the opportunity for candidates to earn some income as they learn.

**Become Licensed and Secure Employment**

Once the classroom and on-the-job aspects of their training are complete, aspiring plumbers in Indiana may acquire a professional license and apply for relevant job positions. We examine the conditions required for obtaining a plumbing license in Indiana below.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

To receive a plumbing license in Indiana, candidates must apply to the [Indiana Plumbing Commission](https://www.in.gov/pla/professions/plumbing-home/plumbing-board/) of the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency. As stated above, the commission requires candidates to have completed both classroom and on-the-job training, specifically 576 hours of training in the classroom and 6,400 hours on the job.

From there, candidates must pass the licensing exam and pay all applicable fees.

Indiana has three types of plumbing licenses:

* The Apprentice license,
* The Journeyman license, and
* The Plumbing Contractor license.

The apprentice license is available for all candidates enrolled in an approved apprenticeship training program, while the journeyman license applies to those who have completed their training.

A plumbing contractor license is needed to take on larger contracts. Candidates applying for this license must have four (4) years of experience as a journeyman plumber.

## **Salary & Career Outlook**

As an aspiring plumber in Indiana, you may look forward to a salary of around $59,431 when you begin your career. Of course, the figure can be lower or higher than this value depending on several factors.

For example, a plumber in the state who can maximize these factors successfully can find themselves among the top 10%, earning an annual average salary of around $90,861. On the other end of the spectrum, those who are yet to maximize these factors may find themselves among the bottom 10% of earners, taking home an annual average salary of $59,431.

These determining factors include experience, specialty, place of employment, credentials, and location.
