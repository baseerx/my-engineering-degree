## **Top Plumbing Schools in Indianapolis, Indiana**

Candidates must be at least 18 years old, pass a criminal background check, and have a high school diploma or GED to be offered admission here.

They will then learn crucial topics to ensure they can keep up with plumbing duties.

Of course, graduates must also pass through an apprenticeship program afterward to meet the licensing requirements.
