## **How to Become a Plumber in Massachusetts**

**Step 1: Complete Secondary Education**

Every plumber in Massachusetts must have a high school diploma or GED. This is not because an official law mandates it but because employers, trade schools, and apprenticeships tend to admit only candidates with either of these credentials.

**Step 2: Enroll for Training**

The most crucial step to becoming a plumber is acquiring the training needed to perform your duties. There are, however, quite a few options to consider in this regard, each with its benefits over the other.

**Vocational School**

The first option to obtain plumbing training in Massachusetts is to enroll in a formal plumbing program at a trade/vocational school or a college nearby.

The benefits of this approach include an emphasis on building a solid classroom foundation, a little bit of hands-on training, and intense preparation for licensing exams.

**Apprenticeship**

Programs organized by trade unions, organizations, and select companies are the next viable alternative for acquiring plumbing training. The benefits of these programs include the opportunity for real-world experience, mentorship, and a rigorous hands-on foundation right from the start.

**Fast-Tracked Plumbing Course**

Accredited fast-tracked courses for plumbers are another viable option. The benefit of this approach is the speed. These programs can be completed in only 8 - 10 weeks.

**Step 3: Obtain Work Experience**

Those looking to shore up their education with real-world experience may consider working as a plumber's assistant before securing employment.

This applies to graduates of plumbing training programs, fast-tracked courses, and registered apprentices who desire a little bit more experience as an assistant before working on their own.

**Step 4: Apply for Licensure**

After graduating from a training program or an apprenticeship, the next step is to become a licensed plumber. We look at some of the most essential steps in this process in one of the upcoming sections below.
