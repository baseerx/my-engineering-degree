The program costs $1,830 for resident students.

The organization itself - the Southwest Mountain States Carpenters - consists of more than 50,000 men and women.

Completing the SWMSCTF training program opens the door to numerous opportunities, including attractive salaries, affordable healthcare, and many more.

The program boasts several training centers all over the country. California students can opt for their center in South LA.

## **Carpentry Career Outlook**

You'll be glad to know that the career outlook for carpentry is generally favorable. At a [2% growth projection](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/carpenters.htm#tab-6) for ten years between 2021 and 2031, the occupation's average growth rate is slightly lower than the national average.

Regardless, this projection will still result in about 91,000 job openings annually within that period for interested carpenters.

While most of these openings will arise due to older workers retiring or moving into new fields, a great deal of them will result from the continuing increase in population and the need to erect new buildings and renovate old ones.
