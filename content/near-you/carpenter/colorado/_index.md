The following are the key requirements for becoming a carpenter in Colorado.

**Basic Requirements**

The basic requirements to become a carpenter in Colorado include being at least 17 years old, having a high school diploma or GED, and being proficient in certain mathematics and geometry subjects.

All of these will make the next steps of the process much more convenient.

**Apprenticeship Training**

By enrolling in an apprenticeship program, aspiring carpenters in Colorado set themselves on a path to receive complete and robust training. This is because apprenticeship programs typically strike a balance between classroom training and hands-on training.

Candidates will learn in real-world environments under the tutelage of experienced and successful carpenters in the state.

These programs are typically organized by employers, professional organizations, government initiatives, and trade unions in the state.

**Academic Training**

Academic training is an alternative to or an addition to apprenticeship programs. Candidates may enroll in trade and technical schools for such training.

The duration depends on the degree in sight. Some programs can be completed in a few weeks, while others take months or years.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

Colorado does not issue a specific license to carpenters, meaning professionals in this field may begin their careers without worrying about registration or a state licensing exam.

Those who want professional credentials to stand out, further their careers, or specialize may consider any nationally recognized organizations offering such credentials. These include the National Association of the Remodeling Industry, the US Green Building Council, and the National Wood Flooring Association.

OSHA and the Red Cross also offer specific safety and adherence certifications that are mandatory for specific projects or useful for pursuing career opportunities.
