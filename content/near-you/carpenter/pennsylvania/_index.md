## **How to Become a Carpenter in Pennsylvania**

The following are the steps involved in becoming a carpenter in Pennsylvania:

**Basic Requirements**

Carpenters in Pennsylvania must start by enrolling in a training program. They are usually asked to provide a copy of their high school diploma or GED to secure admission into these programs. Some programs also stipulate that candidates must be at least 17 years old to apply.

**Training**

Once the primary conditions above have been fulfilled, the next step in becoming a carpenter in PA is to either receive training on the job or enroll in a formal training program. Both of these approaches have their benefits.

* **Formal Training Programs** - Formal carpentry training programs are offered by secondary institutions such as colleges and trade schools all over Pennsylvania. These programs are known to complement their classroom training with practical sessions in state-of-the-art workshops and laboratories.

Formal training programs are usually the most advisable route, as they make employment much more accessible after graduation.

* **Apprenticeships** - Apprenticeship programs have their benefits, not the least that they usually provide a great deal of real-world experience. Thanks to this, graduates of apprenticeship programs are usually familiar with the real-world demands of the job before they branch out on their own. While some apprenticeship programs can be completed in a year or two, some take four years.
* **Carpenters Assistant** - Lastly, aspiring carpenters in Pennsylvania who seek a different approach to the two options above may apply directly to work as an assistant for a practicing carpenter in the state.

There, they get to act as an understudy picking up the essential skills they need to branch out independently and start taking on contracts independently.

## **Carpentry Licensure and Certification Requirements in Pennsylvania**

The [Commonwealth of Pennsylvania](https://www.pa.gov/) currently does not mandate contractors to obtain a license from the state. Still, it is advisable to check with local jurisdictions to ensure no further requirements at that level.

Of course, certification is a different issue from licensure.

Carpenters in Pennsylvania who pursue certification usually do so because it helps them stand out, prove their competence, and make the employment-seeking process much more manageable.

As for the actual certification alternatives, there are quite a handful of them to consider. Among these are the Green Building and Sustainable Technology credential and the Certified Lead Carpenter credential.

It is also common for carpenters in Pennsylvania to pursue OSHA and Red Cross certifications.

## **Salary and Job Outlook**

An average carpenter in Pennsylvania takes home an annual salary of $59,121, the same as the national average. Initially, this figure may be closer to around $42,747, but with time and optimization of a few other factors, it may get as high as $81,768.

One factor that plays a massive role in determining how much a carpenter will earn in Pennsylvania is their location in the state. For instance, carpenters in Chalfont earn an annual average salary of $75,683, while those in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh earn average wages of $65,372 and $62,866 per year, respectively.
