Carpenters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, use their skilled hands and creativity to fabricate furniture from wood, producing all sorts of wonderful designs that serve aesthetic and practical functions and allow us to live more conveniently. They must also be comfortable with hand and power tools to achieve their objectives.

Becoming comfortable with these tools and learning to channel their creative side usually takes time, practice, and guidance. To achieve all of these things, aspiring carpenters often enroll in a training program or participate in an apprenticeship program.

Below, we look at a few top programs offering quality training in and around Minneapolis.

## How to Become a Carpenter in Minneapolis

The first step to becoming a carpenter in Minneapolis is enrolling in a training program. Candidates may combine academic and hands-on training “on the job.”

Community colleges and trade schools are perfect examples of the former, while apprentice programs are great examples of the latter. Of course, those who want to avoid combining may opt for any of these training destinations and be well-equipped to start their careers.

Lastly, candidates may consider getting certified by professional organizations with national recognition for easier employment and better career opportunities. These include the National Center for Construction Education and Research (NCCER) and the Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC).
