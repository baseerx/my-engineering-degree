## **How to Become a Carpenter in Minnesota**

Below are the steps all aspiring carpenters in Minnesota are advised to take to launch their careers successfully.

**Step 1: Meeting the Basic Requirements**

Generally, an aspiring carpenter in Minnesota must be at least 18 years old and have a high school diploma or equivalent. They will need to confirm these requirements at various points along the way.

**Step 2: Enrolling in a Training Program**

Training is the most important part of becoming a carpenter. Several institutions offer top-quality carpentry training in Minnesota, including apprenticeship programs, academic programs, and other on-the-job training arrangements.

**Academic Training**

Trade schools, technical schools, and community colleges offer academic training for future carpenters in Minnesota. They include specialty programs, general carpentry programs offered by workforce departments, and carpentry programs offered as part of a wider construction program.

We will look at some of these programs in an upcoming list below.

**On-the-Job Training**

On-the-job training arrangements allow candidates to learn in the real world. While some classroom training is usually provided, most of the curriculum is geared toward hands-on training in a real-world environment.

Candidates may combine academic and on-the-job training to get the best of both worlds. Apprenticeship programs offer a nice balance between classroom training and real-world training.

Additionally, some trade schools partner with professional organizations to offer a complete academic and hands-on training experience.

**Step 3: Specialization and Marketable Skills**

Lastly, candidates may consider specialization to set themselves apart and make it easier to secure employment while taking advantage of career growth opportunities.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

In Minnesota, as in most states, carpenter licensing is not statewide. It is up to local governments to specify their licensing requirements.

Additionally, licensing requirements are often subject to change. For this reason, it is highly important to check in with local authorities for up-to-date information.

As for certification, candidates may consider local options such as the ones offered by the National Center for Construction Education and Research (NCCER). The National Association of the Remodeling Industry (NARI) and the Associated Builders and Contractors (ABCs) are other respectable alternatives.
