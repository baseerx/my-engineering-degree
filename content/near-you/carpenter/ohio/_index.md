## **How to Become a Carpenter in Ohio**

There are two ways to begin a carpentry career in Ohio. The first involves getting a formal education through an academic program, while the second involves enrolling in an apprenticeship program.

**Formal Academic Programs**

A formal academic program prepares carpenters to be sound in the job's theoretical and practical aspects. Typically, community colleges and vocational institutions offer these programs, and can be completed in a few months or a few years, depending on how the students want to go.

Those with a long-term view may enroll in a comprehensive construction program that can be completed in 4 years. Graduates of such programs will leave with a bachelor of science degree. Those looking for a shorter program to begin working as fast as possible may opt for certificate programs that can be completed in a few months.

**Apprenticeship Programs**

Apprenticeship programs for aspiring carpenters in Ohio are thorough, focusing predominantly on practical experience and helping students get their hands on tools as quickly as possible. That said, apprenticeship programs also incorporate classroom training so that students are able to understand the theoretical principles behind the things they are being taught.

**Carpenter's Assistant**

Those who wish to obtain training as aspiring carpenters without enrolling in an apprenticeship program may consider working directly under a licensed carpenter as a carpenter's assistant. This provides a more direct and personal form of education that may also include a degree of mentorship.

## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

A carpenter does not need a license to start working there in Ohio. However, to start a business and be able to take on larger contracts, the state requires a contractor license. To obtain this license, candidates must be at least 18 years old.

They must also be citizens of the United States or legal aliens. Once the above requirements are met, candidates must submit their application, including the processing fee, complete a background check, pass the trade exam, and render proof of insurance.

Certain aspects of these steps may vary from city to city. For instance, Columbus's minimum liability insurance coverage is 300,000, while Cincinnati requires 100,000 and Cleveland 200,000.
