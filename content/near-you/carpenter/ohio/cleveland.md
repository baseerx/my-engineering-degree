## **How to Become a Carpenter in Cleveland**

In Cleveland, Ohio, carpenters are not expected to obtain a state license before starting working. For this reason, simply meeting the basic educational requirements and getting training will qualify aspiring carpenters to secure employment in the state.

For their training, candidates may attend a formal school or enroll in an apprenticeship program to obtain on-the-job training.

Despite no state carpentry licensure requirements in Ohio, aspiring contractors must obtain a general contractor license, which includes an application process, payment of a processing fee, and completion of a background check.
