**Apprenticeship Programs**

The second option for receiving carpentry training is enrolling in an apprenticeship program. These programs ensure that students learn the trade in a classroom and while performing their jobs in a real-world environment.

They also offer valuable mentorship from professionals with years of experience in the field.

**Carpenter's Assistants**
