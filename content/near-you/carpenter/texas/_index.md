Carpenters are craftsmen with the gift of transforming raw wooden materials into functional and aesthetic pieces. But even though being talented is a significant part of being a carpenter, a great deal of the job description comes down to proper training.

For an aspiring carpenter in Texas, going through some training program is a must. But additional requirements must be fulfilled, such as meeting the essential prerequisites for admission and possibly pursuing certification and licensure.

In case this seems overwhelming, we assure you it is not. To simplify the process, we have provided a comprehensive guide below containing everything you need to know to kickstart your career as a carpenter in Texas.

## **How to Become a Carpenter in Texas**

**Step 1: Fulfill the Basic Requirements**

Carpenters in Texas can get started by enrolling in a formal or apprenticeship training program. Both require candidates to be at least 17 years old before they can apply.

**Step 2A: Enroll in a Training Program**

Once admitted into a formal training program, you can expect rigorous classroom training sessions dealing with the construction and erection of wood frame structures.

These programs can last a few months to four years, depending on the structure of the program and the degree in sight.

**Step 2B: Enroll in an Apprenticeship Program**

Those not wanting to enroll in a formal training program can consider registering for an apprenticeship instead. The main reason people enroll in internships is that they get the chance to learn on the job while working with experienced professionals who can also offer mentorship.

Both of these approaches have their strengths and weaknesses. Still, regardless of which direction you choose, the most essential thing in your journey to becoming a successful carpenter is to pay attention to what you're being taught and find a way to incorporate creative thinking and problem-solving into your work.

## **Carpentry Licensure and Certification Requirements in Texas**

Like most states in the country, Texas does not have a statewide licensing mandate for carpenters. The only consideration to make would be whether or not a specific municipality has its local licensing mandates.

Certification is another important question the carpenter must answer besides licensing. The issue of whether to get certified or not is usually down to a question of personal preference. Certification makes it possible to stand out from the pack and obtain credentials to show competence in a particular field.

For carpenters, the most common certification alternatives are the *Certified Lead Carpenter* credential offered by the National Association of the Remodelling Industry, the *Green Building and Sustainable Technology* credential provided by the US Green Building Council, and some safety standard certifications offered by OSHA and the Red Cross.

## **Salary and Job Outlook**

Aspiring carpenters in Texas can expect an annual average salary of $54,695. If they make it to the top 10% of earners in the state, they will take home around $76,233.

However, they will most likely take home an average salary of $39,242 per year.

Experience also matters when determining how much a carpenter will earn in Texas. One to two years of experience in the state usually equate to an annual average salary of $50,041. In comparison, those with more than 10 years of experience earn an average yearly salary of $64,199.

Austin, Pearland, Houston, Taylor, and Fort Worth are the highest-paying cities for carpenters in Texas. San Antonio and El Paso follow closely.
