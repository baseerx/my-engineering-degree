Carpenters work with wooden and other raw materials to create beautiful furniture pieces that make our lives more comfortable and beautify our environment.

A carpenter must undergo proper training to perform their jobs at the highest possible level. Most choose to obtain this training from a carpentry school.

Since there are no licensing requirements for carpenters in San Antonio, Texas, the next step of the process involves acquiring a little bit of real-world experience – perhaps working as a carpenter's assistant – before pursuing independent contracts.
