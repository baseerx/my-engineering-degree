## **How to Become a Carpenter in Illinois**

Becoming a carpenter in Illinois involves pretty much the same steps it does in most states. The first thing you have to do is choose a specific approach, and in this case, you have three different options.

The first option is to apply for an apprenticeship opportunity trade unions offer. The second option is to work as a carpenter assistant for a few years before becoming one yourself. And the last approach is to apply for an official training program at a college or trade school.

Of course, it is also possible to combine two of these approaches. For example, an aspiring carpenter may first complete an apprenticeship program and consolidate their knowledge by also applying for a course at a local college or vocational school in Illinois.
