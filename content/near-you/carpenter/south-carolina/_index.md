## How to Become a Carpenter in South Carolina

The following are the four major considerations to enjoy a successful career as a carpenter in South Carolina:

**A High School Diploma Or GED**

MA high school diploma is a minimum educational requirement to become a carpenter in South Carolina, and those who don't have one may use a GED or other equivalent.

**Apprenticeship Training**

Apprenticeship programs for South Carolina carpenters may last 2 - 4 years. They include high-level training under experienced supervisors.

The best programs will also incorporate classroom instructions to ensure that students are sound in that aspect.

Candidates may contact the ***Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry*** for more information on approved carpentry apprenticeship programs.

**Academic Training**

Candidates in South Carolina may choose to attend academic programs instead of an apprenticeship program. They may also combine both approaches.

The exact amount of time spent in an academic carpentry program will depend on several factors, including the structure of the program and the degree desired.

For instance, specialty programs may take 6—2 years to complete; general carpentry programs offered by workforce departments may take a couple of weeks; and carpentry programs offered as part of a wider construction program may take 2 to 4 years to complete.

**Developing Advanced Skills**

Lastly, even after training, candidates are expected to improve and stay updated on tools and techniques continually. They may also consider specializing in a particular field and earning a professional credential.

## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

Local jurisdictions rather than state bodies often define the licensing requirements for carpenters in South Carolina. Even then, local jurisdictions typically allow carpenters to practice their crafts professionally without bothering with licensing examinations.

That said, it is always imperative that fresh carpenters check in with local boards, such as the [South Carolina Contractor's Licensing Board](https://llr.sc.gov/clb/clb_general.aspx), concerning updated licensing and certification requirements.

Those looking to acquire nationally recognized professional credentials to enjoy the benefits of doing so have multiple alternatives. Some of the most relevant options include the ***Certified Plus Carpentry*** credential offered by the *National Center for Construction Education and Research* and the ***Certified Lead Carpenter*** credential offered by the *National Association of the Remodeling Industry*.
