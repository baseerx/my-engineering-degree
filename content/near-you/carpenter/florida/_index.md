The basic requirements for aspiring carpenters in Florida include just two main conditions. The first is that they must be at least 17 years old, while the second stipulates that they must already have their high school diploma or GED.

Students also get to graduate with a certificate diploma or even an associate degree, depending on the particular program they apply for.

**On-the-Job Training**

Instead of enrolling in a formal training program, carpenters in Florida may consider enrolling in an apprenticeship program. Here they receive hands-on training from established professionals through initiatives run by trade unions or approved companies.

Those who desire on-the-job training may also consider applying for a role as a carpenter's assistant. In this arrangement, they get to work as an understudy for practicing carpenters for a few years before moving on to open their shop or secure employment elsewhere.
