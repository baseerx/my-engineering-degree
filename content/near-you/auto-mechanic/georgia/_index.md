## **How to Become an Auto Mechanic in Georgia**

Below is an optimal pathway for starting an automotive mechanic career in Georgia.

**Ensure You're Ready**

Aspiring automotive mechanics in Georgia may prepare themselves for what's to come by brushing up on certain basic subjects, including mathematics and computer usage. They will also need a high school diploma or GED to be accepted into top training programs.

**Acquire Proper Training**

Training to become an automotive mechanic can be quite intensive. For this reason, it is important to get the steps right.

One of the first things you must ensure is selecting the right training program. We have provided a list of notable options below. Still, remember that the best programs are usually accredited by the National Automotive Technicians Education Foundation (NATEF).

These programs will give you a solid foundation in suspension, steering, fuel, and general auto repair and maintenance.

Automotive mechanics may also enroll in apprenticeship programs to acquire hands-on training and real-world experience before seeking employment.

**Certification**

Automotive mechanics in Georgia are not bound by law to seek certification. That said, acquiring certification can go a long way in helping professionals stand out in front of possible employers.

The Automotive Service Excellence offers several certifications for automotive mechanics nationwide. To earn this certification, candidates must have had two years of experience and pass a standardized exam. Other requirements may vary depending on the exact certification in sight.

Some popular alternatives include the automobile and light-truck credential, the collision repair and refinishing credential, truck equipment, and medium-heavy truck certification.
