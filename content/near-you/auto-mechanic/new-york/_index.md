A career as an automotive mechanic is perfect for anyone who appreciates how cars work and would love to know how to fix the intricate machinery that powers them. And even though it may seem daunting on the surface, the path to becoming an auto mechanic is direct.

For aspiring auto mechanics in New York, this path usually involves obtaining training in one of two ways. It also involves making some licensing and certification considerations along the way.

We have provided the guide below to shed more light on these aspects of becoming an automotive mechanic in New York City and many more.

## **How to Become an Automotive Mechanic in New York**

Auto mechanics in New York usually start their careers by either receiving training on the job or applying for admission into a training program.

As one would expect, both of these approaches have their merits. For instance, those who choose to get training on the job — perhaps through an apprenticeship program — often get to work hand-in-hand with established professionals in the field who already have tons of experience themselves.

They can tap into this wealth of knowledge and receive mentorship while they learn the trade.

On the other hand, training programs offer structure and a strong theoretical foundation. Students get to develop a solid understanding of what they are expected to do before they do it.

It is also possible to combine both to ensure that you have enough classroom training mixed with hands-on practical.

Before enrolling in either of these programs, having your high school diploma or GED ready is advisable.

While the state doesn't mandate this, it is usually asked for by employers.
