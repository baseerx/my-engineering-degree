## **How to Become an Auto Mechanic in Oklahoma**

The general pathway toward becoming an auto mechanic in Oklahoma involves acquiring training and experience and securing employment. However, a few steps have to be sandwiched here and there for the most optimal outcome.

**Step 1: The Prerequisites**

To qualify for the appropriate training required to become a practicing auto mechanic in Oklahoma, you must possess a high school diploma or GED. It also helps to have taken courses in high school related to mechanics, mathematics, and computer science.

**Step 2: Enroll in a Training Program in Oklahoma**

A handful of mechanics practice with an associate's degree or bachelor's degree, but this is by no means a mandatory requirement. Obtaining certificate training from a vocational institution or community college is enough to start.

While associate's degrees take no less than two years to complete, certificate programs can be completed in as little as ten months.

**Step 3: Getting Experience**

To begin practicing as an auto mechanic in Oklahoma, you must obtain formal theoretical and real-world, hands-on training. While institutions do their best to stimulate practical environments, internships and apprenticeship programs are the best way to get this experiment truly.

What's more, earning through these programs and getting your first taste of being a paid mechanic is possible.

## **Getting Licensed and Certified**

Like most states, Oklahoma has no strict license requirement for auto mechanics. The only mandatory certification applies to those who work with refrigerants. In this case, they have to get certified by EPA - the environment protection agency.

That said, most employers often like their mechanics to get certified, and as such, most do so through the Automotive Service Excellence (ASE).

**ASE Certification**

ASE certification is available nationwide. They provide certification in a handful of categories, including engine repair, manual drivetrain and axles, brakes, air conditioning, heating and cooling systems, suspension and steering, and engine performance.

Candidates must possess a high school diploma/GED and a driver's license to qualify.

**Continuing Education & Professional Organizations**

Lastly, having obtained certification as an auto mechanic, it is usually a good idea to keep up with the changing professional landscape by going through continuing education.

Joining a professional organization can also be a good idea, not only because they assist with continuing education but because they also organize workshops and events and provide access to essential resources.
