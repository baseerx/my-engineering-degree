## **How to Become an Auto Mechanic in Minnesota**

Aspiring auto mechanics in Minnesota may consider the options below to launch their careers.

**Minimum Educational Requirements**

The minimum educational requirement to become an auto mechanic in Minnesota is a high school diploma or GED. This is important to secure employment and admission into training programs.

Candidates are also expected to have a driver's license and be proficient in basic mathematics and physics.

**Apprenticeship Training**

For optimal hands-on training, it is common for candidates in Minnesota to attend apprenticeship training programs to begin their auto mechanic careers. These programs are usually organized by trade unions, dealerships, auto manufacturers, and trade schools.

Most last for a couple of years and include mentorships from established auto professionals in the state.

This is perfect for candidates who are not easily disposed toward academic training. It is also perfect for those who wish to earn some income while they earn (although not all apprenticeships provide this opportunity).

**Formal Academic Training**

On the other hand, those who love learning in a structured classroom environment may choose to attend a formal training program. Here, they can look forward to learning in state-of-the-art facilities and wonderful classrooms under the tutelage of instructors with years of experience doing their jobs.

They can also look forward to developing a strong theoretical foundation upon which they can acquire more skills when practicing what they have been taught.

**Combining Multiple Approaches**

It is worth mentioning that even though an apprenticeship or an academic program is enough to start an automotive mechanic career in Minnesota, some choose to combine both approaches for a fuller education.

Some schools also allow students to seek part-time employment and on-the-job training opportunities while still enrolled.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

Minnesota has no mandatory licensure requirement for candidates looking to work as automotive mechanics. They do not need certification either, but most choose to do so for the personal and professional benefits.

For instance, the **National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence** (ASE) offers an array of professional credentials for auto mechanics in Minnesota that can go a long way in providing career opportunities.

As a fresh auto mechanic, certification will give you an edge over fellow mechanics just starting their careers. To employers, certification legitimizes your skills to a certain extent and provides significant credibility.
