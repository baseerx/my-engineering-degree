As for the actual training, you can choose to attend a formal training program run by a trade school or Community College, and you can also choose to enroll in an apprenticeship program instead.

Most people choose the training program route because it leads to a more leisurely road toward employment. However, this is not to say that apprenticeship programs don't have their benefits either. These kinds of programs provide tangible hands-on training and mentorship opportunities.
