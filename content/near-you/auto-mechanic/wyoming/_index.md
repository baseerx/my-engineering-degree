## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

Just like most states, Wyoming does not have any strict licensing requirements for its automotive mechanics. The only group of people you will have to worry about when it comes to certification is the employers.

Employers tend to prefer auto mechanics who are certified. For this reason, many auto mechanics in the state choose to get certified by the ASE (Automotive Service Excellence).

To become certified, candidates must meet two key requirements: obtain two years of experience, either on the job or through a training program, and pass a specialized exam. Certification will last for 5 years, after which it must be renewed through continuing education.
