## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

Once you graduate from an auto mechanic school, the next thing to worry about, of course, is the issue of certification and licensure. Firstly, it is worth mentioning that Vermont has no particular licensing requirement.

Auto mechanics can work in the state without worrying about getting licensed. Certification, on the other hand, is another issue entirely. Again, the state has no certification requirement, but employers are always adamant that their employees be certified by the ASE.

To become ASE certified, candidates must have 2 years of related work experience. This can be a combination of experience gained through training and on the job.

They must also pass the appropriate exam for their specialization.
