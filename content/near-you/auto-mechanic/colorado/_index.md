## **How to Become an Auto Mechanic in Colorado**

Automotive mechanics in Colorado typically begin their careers by fulfilling the key requirements highlighted below.

**Complete High School**

As a minimum educational requirement, aspiring auto mechanics in Colorado must have at least a high school diploma. Those who don't have a diploma may make use of a GED or any other equivalent document in its place.

Candidates must have a driver's license at least 18 years old.

**Complete Training**

Training in automotive technology can be acquired from two general sources. These include apprenticeship programs and academic training programs.

* ***Apprenticeship Programs*** — Apprenticeship programs allow candidates to learn crucial topics in automotive technology, focusing on real-world experience. Most programs will also try as much as possible to teach fundamental theoretical principles in a classroom environment.

Professional organizations, unions, government initiatives, auto companies, and trade schools organize auto mechanic apprenticeships.

* ***Academic Schooling*** — Candidates looking for top-quality automotive technology training in Colorado may consider technical colleges and trade schools. These programs are designed to prepare students in all major aspects of modern automotive systems.
