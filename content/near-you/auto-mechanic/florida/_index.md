## **How To Become an Automotive Mechanic in Florida**

**Basic Prerequisites**

The essential requirement is the first thing you must concern yourself about on your journey to become an auto mechanic in Florida. This includes being a High School graduate with a diploma to show for it or having a GED in its place.

While no law in the country mandates applicants to have these credentials, employers and training programs often ask for them.

**Training Programs**

After fulfilling the prerequisites above, the next step is to enroll in a training program to learn what is required of you when you start working. Now there are two broad approaches to this: acquiring training on the job through an apprenticeship and enrolling in a formal training program.

**On-the-Job Training**

Since there are no basic post-secondary educational requirements for auto mechanics in Florida, aspiring candidates can enroll in apprenticeship programs or work as assistants to mechanics to obtain their training on the job.

**Formal Training Programs**

The second alternative to on-the-job training is enrolling in a formal training program. These programs offer a structured environment where students can learn the fundamentals of their jobs before they're actually thrown into the field.

The best training programs also incorporate a little bit of hands-on practical sessions so that students can put to the test what they are being taught in the classroom.

## **Licensure and Certification Requirements**

Just like most states, Florida has no mandatory licensing requirements for its auto mechanics. There are also no mandatory certification requirements, but most professionals choose to get certified anyway because it makes finding employment easier and can be an excellent way to remain accountable for self-improvement.

Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) is usually the go-to organization for certification in automotive mechanics. One of the best parts of becoming certified with the ASE is choosing your areas of specialization and focusing on those.

To become certified, candidates are usually required to have acquired training on the job or graduated from a training program. They will also have to sit for and pass a special examination.

## **Salary and Job Outlook**

On average, auto mechanics in Florida earn an annual base salary of $59,598. Factors such as experience, location, certification, and type of employer can all influence whether or not an auto mechanic falls above or below the average.

Those just starting may fall into the bottom 10% and earn an annual average salary of $36,444. Those who have garnered enough experience and have spent time perfecting their craft can make as high as $97,460.
