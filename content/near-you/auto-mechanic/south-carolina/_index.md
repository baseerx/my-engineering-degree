## **How to Become an Auto Mechanic in South Carolina**

Below are the key considerations for launching an auto mechanic career in South Carolina.

**Basic Prerequisites**

The first thing that candidates have to worry about on their road to becoming an auto mechanic in South Carolina is the basic educational requirement. This includes being a high school graduate possessing either a diploma or a GED equivalent in its place.

While no law in the country mandates applicants to have these credentials, employers and training programs usually ask for it.

**Obtaining Technical Training**

Moving on from the basic prerequisite, the next step to becoming an auto mechanic in South Carolina is to acquire formal training.

Thankfully, there are numerous training programs all over the state, which can be separated into two categories â€” academic programs and apprenticeship/on-the-job training programs.

**Academic Programs vs On-the-Job Training**

Technical colleges and trade schools in South Carolina offer top-quality automotive technology training to prepare future auto mechanics for their duties. Apprenticeship programs and certain auto companies and car dealers also offer candidates the opportunity to learn on the job.

Academic programs focus on classroom instructions but usually make provisions for hands-on training.

Some may do so in the school workshop or via internships and collaboration with automakers and dealerships.

It is also possible to combine both academic programs and on-the-job training. For instance, some academic programs allow candidates to secure part-time employment elsewhere while still enrolled and learning.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

As an auto mechanic in South Carolina, you don't have to worry about getting a license from a state board or any other state commission. You also technically don't have to worry about certification either.

However, many auto mechanics in the state still choose to become certified anyway, simply because of the practical benefits of doing so. For one, certified usually have a significant edge over those who are not. Certification also goes a long way in helping candidates stand out in their specialty fields.

For some time now, the ***National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence*** (ASE) has been considered the most popular destination for auto mechanics looking to obtain respectable certification in a specialized field. The Automotive Service Excellence offers the opportunity to become certified as an automobile electrical/electronic systems specialist and engine repair specialist, among others.
