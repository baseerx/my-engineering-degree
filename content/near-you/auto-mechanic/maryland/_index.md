## **How to Become an Auto Mechanic in Maryland**

Below is a step-by-step breakdown of Maryland's requirements for becoming an automotive mechanic.

**Get a High School Diploma or GED**

Even though you may technically be able to start an auto mechanic career in Maryland without postsecondary degrees, the truth is that most employers will exclude you from employment if you have yet to graduate high school or have an equivalent qualification.

**Apply for a Trade Program**

Technical training is the most important part of being an auto mechanic. Trade schools and community colleges offer comprehensive training in modern automotive technology that candidates may leverage to start their careers properly.

**Acquire Hands-On Experience**

Trade programs prepare students for auto mechanic careers by focusing on fundamental theories. For practical applications, the programs often make provisions for students to participate in internships.

Many schools also partner with Ford, Honda, and Toyota brands. Through this, candidates get a chance to work in actual dealerships and repair shops to gain first-hand experience of the craft even before they graduate.

**Consider Certification**

Aspiring mechanics in Maryland are encouraged to become certified to increase their chances of employment. Certification also leads to better networking opportunities, higher credibility, and a chance to improve through continuing education.

## **Licensure & Certification Requirements**

Like most other places nationwide, Maryland does not have mandatory licensing requirements for practicing automotive mechanics. Candidates are expected to check in with their local counties for any possible permits, but this is also quite rare.

Despite not being mandatory, certification from a professional organization offers several benefits, and as such, it is common to see professionals become certified as quickly as possible.

The prominent options to consider for certification as an automotive mechanic in Maryland include those offered by the ***National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence*** (ASE).

Thanks to the ASE, candidates may obtain highly respected professional credentials verifying them as specialists in fields such as Electrical/Electronic Systems, Automatic Transmission/Transaxle, and Engine Repair, among many others.
